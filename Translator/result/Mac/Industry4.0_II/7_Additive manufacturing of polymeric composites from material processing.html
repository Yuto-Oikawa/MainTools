Finally, this review is concluded with an outlook on future research opportunities on AM-fabricated composites from design to fabrication. This review aims to provide a comprehensive guide to the stakeholders who want to utilize or develop an AM process for polymeric composites. 1.Introduction Additively manufactured composites are an emerging category of materials with unique advantages of tailorable material formulation, functional reinforcements, spatial arrangement of phases, and three- dimensional (3D) complex geometries [1]. For instance, additively manufactured biocomposite, polymeric composite, and polymer-derived ceramic composite exhibit their unique advantages as compared with composites fabricated by conventional approaches such as molding, tooling, cutting [2,3]. The limitations of polymer Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies in material properties, production efficiency, energy consumption, and part size for end-use usage can be overcome with the advances of AM fabricated composite [4]. Polymeric composites offer opportunities to extend the applications from rapid prototyping to functional, load-bearing, electromagnetic shielding, and other end-use parts [5,6]. Composites via AM have exploited the design and manufacturing freedom through which short and long fibers are incorporated with the AM processes to form engineerable patterns in 3D and the digitalized composites are available to be designed and fabricated in a voxel-by-voxel manner [7]. Most polymer AM processes can be employed to fabricate polymeric composites with desirable material compositions. However, the distribution of different phases, aspect ratio of fibers, and spital arrangements of continuous or short fibers highly depend on the preparation of feedstock materials and process patterning strategy [8]. The resolution, surface finishing, and other process limitations are usually identified case-by-case with respect to different AM techniques. Additionally, in past decades, design and manufacturing freedom is mainly focusing on the fabrication of complex structures on macroscale. Recently, digitalized and materialized composite fabrication is realized by voxelated AM *Corresponding author.

To date, intensive efforts are devoted to the functional design of additively manufactured composites, including mechanical [10,11], acoustic [12], electromagnetic metamaterials [13,14], thermally and electrically conductive structures [15], water treatment [16], etc. AM techniques offer the opportunity to create artificial and structural materials with unusual properties in nature such as negative Poisson ratio, negative thermal expansion, negative reflection index [17]. Therefore, different types of metamaterials and digital composites with extraordinary mechanical, electromagnetic, and acoustic performances are developed using AM techniques in recent years. However, the reliability and feasibility of multi-material or multi-process AM still remain challenges toward function-driven fabrication. The key route to solve this issue is unifying numerical-driven, and data-driven design strategies, such as topology optimization (TO) and machine learning algorithms with the Process-Structure-Properties-Performance (PSPP) relationship of a multi-material or composite AM process [18–20]. Specifically, a numerical optimization method can be applied on multiple design scales to update the parameters on micro, meso, and macroscale of AM fabricated polymetric composites. To summarize those recent research efforts, this work aims to provide a comprehensive review on AM-fabricated polymeric composites, ranging from material processing to their structural design. Comparing to those existing reviews [1,7] on AM fabricated polymeric composites, this paper has three unique aspects: 1) AM techniques available to polymeric composites are briefly discussed in the aspects of their forming mechanisms, feedstock materials, potentials, and constraints of processes; 2) AM-driven material and structural designs of polymeric composites in multiscale are emphasized to establish the comprehensive understanding of PSPP relationship; 3) advances in digital composites, data-driven design/process planning/monitoring of composite, and composite 4D printing are addressed to reveal the opportunities and perspectives. Ultimately, this work provides insights for future research to bridge the gaps between advanced process and digital design, and fully explore the potentials of AM-fabricated composites in a wide range of applications. 2.AM of polymeric composites The conventional classification of AM processes follows ISO/ ASTM52900 standard [21]. Herein, additively manufactured polymeric composites can be broadly classified into continuous fiber and discontinuous (short) composites and voxelated polymeric composites [22–24]. The continuous-fiber reinforced composites via conventional pultrusion and continuous compression molding are well-known lightweight materials as load-bearing structures for the applications of aerospace, automobile, sports, etc [25–28]. However, continuous-fiber reinforced polymeric composites have been rarely manufactured by AM, most notably material extrusion process (e.g. fused filament fabrication (FFF)) and sheet lamination process (e.g. laminated objective manufacturing (LOM)) [29–31]. In comparison, short-fiber reinforced composites have been manufactured by most AM technologies, including material extrusion processes, powder bed fusion processes, vat photopolymerization processes, binder jetting, material jetting, and other alternative hybrid layer-by-layer approaches [32,33]. Voxelated polymeric composites are uniquely manufacturable by AM approaches such as PolyJet (material jetting), multiple jet fusion (MJF, powder bed fusion), and DIW (material extrusion process) [23,34,35]. In the following content, we are going to use a detailed process name such as FFF, DIW instead of its standard category’s name such as material extrusion since they can more precisely describe unique features of these processes. Thermoplastics and thermosets are two categories of polymer matrices, which are mainly incorporating with reinforcements to form multiphase composites or digital arrangement in space to generate multimaterial voxelated matter [23,36–38]. The thermoplastics are pre-processed in the form of a filament or powders as feedstock materials and applied in FFF and powder-based processes such as selective laser sintering (SLS) and MJF [39,40]. On the other hand, the UV-curable and thermal-curable thermoset resins are employed as raw materials for the AM processes, including DIW, reactive extrusion, stereolithography (SLA), inkjet, and PolyJet [9,41–43]. Both thermoplastic and thermoset can be used to incorporate with continuous-fibers to form prepreg tape and then applied in the automated fiber placement (AFP) or LOM process [30,44–46]. 2.1.Extrusion-based process Extrusion-based AM is a versatile approach to construct 3D objects layer-by-layer using various types of feedstock materials, including thermoplastic filaments and pellets, highly viscous hydrogel, and viscoelastic inks of thermosets, etc [47]. This is because the different designs of printing nozzles are adopted into the extrusion system. In principle, extruders, syringes, and other printheads are used to deliver materials with external pressures which can be generated by mechanical force, piezoelectrical stimulation, or pneumatic pressure [48,49]. Due to the unique design for particular printing nozzles, the specific form of feedstocks is selected to adapt to the corresponding extrusion system. Most of the extrusion-based processes can be applied to manufacture short-fiber reinforced polymeric composite. Whereas continuous fibers can be only blended with thermoplastics or thermoset precursors before mechanical extrusion in FFF and DIW. Apart from the feedstock materials, the success of the extrusion- based process of polymeric composites depends on multiple process parameters, including feeding speed, melting temperature, chemical composition, fiber loading, the aspect ratio of fiber, depositing speed, and temperature gradients. The distribution of short fibers and the arrangement of long fibers are engineered by the formulated materials and process patterning, which significantly influence the design strategies to optimize the structural performances of printed parts [50]. The relationships of PSPP of different composites via extrusion-based processes are addressed here. 2.1.1.Fused filament fabrication FFF is a type of material extrusion AM process [43,51]. It employs a thermoplastic filament to feed into the heated printing nozzle and extrude the molten material onto a deposition bed with a computer pre-programmed printing path in a layer-by-layer manner as shown in Fig. 1a [22]. Support structures, using soluble polymers in water or acid, are introduced to improve the surface finish of products and increase the complexity of geometry. The common thermoplastics available to FFF candidate materials mainly include amorphous polymers e.g., polylactic acid (PLA), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), acrylonitrile styrene acrylate, polycarbonate (PC), polystyrene (PS), and a few semi-crystalline polymers e.g., nylon and polyaryletherketone (PAEK) family, polyphenylene (PPS) and polyphenylsulfone (PPSU) [52,53]. These high-performance thermoplastics usually require a high-pressure extruder and heated process chamber to ensure the fluent flow of viscous materials and avoid part warping upon the chamber cooling. The key factors are addressed in a viscoelastic model of FFF to ensure the quality of printed products, including (1) pressure-driven extrusion flow, (2) bead formation, (3) bead functionality, and (4) component functionality [54]. This model can effectively evaluate the influence of compositional variations and identify appropriate processing parameters, which have been demonstrated for specific materials on FFF and large-scale extrusion platforms [55]. Short fibers and continuous fibers can be adopted by the FFF system to build anisotropic composites as illustrated in Fig. 1d–f [58,59]. Large-scale extrusion AM (industrial-scale platform in several meters in three dimensions) is developed for thermoplastics and other composites at high production rates as shown in Fig. 1b [22,56]. A S. Yuan et al. feedstock in pellet form instead of filaments can directly feed into a screw extruder attached to a robotic arm or a large gantry system [22]. The printing nozzle allows a high deposition rate of 25–50 kg/h, and exhibit a large coarse and fine resolution in 7.6 mm and 5.1 mm [57]. 2.1.2.Direct ink writing and reactive extrusion DIW and reactive extrusion are newly developed AM processes to additively deposit a reactive liquid or slurry on a platform and then it will be immediately cured by thermal or ultraviolet (UV) sources to form solid structures as shown in Fig. 2 [35,60,61]. Usually, fibers or other additives are added to thermoset resin to modify the viscosity of Fig. 1.(a) Illustration of FFF process [22]; (b) multiple scale illustration of continuous fiber-reinforced composite via FFF [22]; (c) illustration of large-scale fused deposition using polymeric pellets [22]; (d) geometry of the RVE of the composite with perfectly aligned fibers via FFF [58]; (e) transverse cross-section and (f) longitudinal cross-section for short fiber reinforced composites via FFF [59]. Fig. 2.(a), (e) and (f) frontal polymerization via DIW, its freestanding polymeric structure and its composite structure [61]; (b) and (g) illustration of UV assisted thermoset 3D printing system and reactive extrusion system, respectively [22]; (c) UV assisted coextrusion deposition for continuous fiber-reinforced composition fabrication [60]; (d), (h) and (i) microstructure of transverse and longitudinal cross-section of short fiber-reinforced composite via DIW [32]. S. Yuan et al. feedstock materials so as to become sufficient viscous to hold their shape during printing. In DIW, the catalyst and polymer resin are pre-mixed with modifiers to be a directly printable slurry, which can be instantaneously cured in-situ via exposure to thermal or UV radiation [60,61]. However, in the reactive extrusion process, two extrusion systems are employed to fill a reactive resin and a catalyst to a nozzle head in which they get fully mixed. The resin with catalyst cures exothermically upon printing, and its transient rheology and curing kinetics govern the deposition speed and ensure the strong interfacial bonding among printed beads and layers. Large-scale reactive extrusion AM is rarely reported in current research works, but it enables additively printing reactive thermoset and their composites with a potential of high production rate rather than large-scale thermoplastic extrusion [22]. Acrylic-based photocurable resin and thermal curable epoxy are two main categories of thermoset polymers, which are employed as feedstock materials for DIW and reactive extrusion [32,60]. The syringe extruder equipped with a UV or Near-IR source was used to extrude and cure the polymers. Recently, frontal polymerization is introduced to the extrusion system as its promising alternative curing strategy, which initiates a self-propagating exothermic reaction wave transforms with a rapid curing rate [61]. These reactive thermosets are capable of incorporating carbon fiber, glass fiber, fumed silica, and nanomaterials such as carbon nanotube (CNT), nanoclay, and graphene. These fillers are used to tailor the viscosity, and shear thinning of DIW inks as well as enhance the mechanical and other functionality of printed composites [62]. For instance, epoxy resin EPON 826 is mixed with curing agent, nanoclay, and chopped carbon fiber by shearing force to prepare directly printable inks [63]. The DIW composites exhibited excellent tensile and flexural mechanical properties along the direction of printing in which the carbon fibers show a high degree of fiber alignment. Nanofibers, milled, or chopped short fibers, and continuous fibers are introduced to reinforce the functionalities of polymeric matrices through FFF, DIW, and reactive extrusion [64,65]. The structural design from microscale to macroscale requires a thorough understanding of the process-dependent properties and mechanics of printed polymeric composites, which are associated with the distribution, alignment, loading ratio, and aspect ratio of fibers within matrices. More importantly, multimaterial and multi-nozzle DIW are newly introduced to fabricated voxelated composites, which possess materials with different mechanical strength and modulus [23]. This enables materialized and digitalized freedom of design and manufacturing through assembling material building blocks in a voxel-by-voxel manner. 2.2.Powder-based process Powder-based AM is a widely used technique to construct 3D solid objects through automatically depositing powders and selectively sintering or bonding these powders by a heat source or plastic binders in a layer-by-layer manner. To date, these techniques include SLS, MJF, and binder jetting, which possess the advantages to access new types of polymers and their composites for complex component fabrication without requiring support structures for overhang and thin wall [4,53]. Thermoplastics with semi-crystalline structures are the main candidate materials in SLS, and only polypropylene and polyamide groups are available to MJF till now [52,53]. Whereas, binder jetting enables to adopt different categories of powders due to that its key factors in successful fabrication are binder selection and deposition. Different types of nanofibers and short fibers as reinforcements are introduced to the powder-based AM to improve material processability and enhance the functionalities of printed components. They can be ceramic, metallic, carbon-based fillers, and other organic additives. However, continuous fibers are not available for incorporating polymer matrices in the powder-based processes. Therefore, the microstructure of composites in nano to mesoscale can be tailored by controlling the feedstock materials and fusion process. Meanwhile, the 3D structural designs in macro-scale are mainly engineerable by computer-aided design and TO. 2.2.1.Selective laser sintering SLS is a type of powder bed fusion process. It employed a CO2 laser to provide sufficient thermal energy to selectively trigger the thermoplastic powder fusion on the pre-heated powder bed under a pressure-free condition as shown in Fig. 3a [4,22]. Semi-crystalline thermoplastics (e.g. polyamides, PAEK, polypropylene, and polyethylene) are predominately applied in the SLS system, but amorphous and dual-segment thermoplastics or elastomers such as polyurethanes are also investigated recently [53]. The success of the laser sintering process has stringent requirements for polymers and their composites, including the thermal and rheological properties of their bulk form as well as flowability and optical properties of their powder form [4]. Laser-sintered composites can be generated by two approaches: (1) polymeric powders behave as a plastic binder to glue micro-fillers upon laser scanning to form a solid composite structure [66]; (2) the feedstock powders pre-incorporating with fillers and additives via chemical or mechanical mixing, before they are used for laser sintering to ensure a uniform distribution of fillers and additives [67]. The preparation of polymeric composite powders or mixed polymer/filler powders eventually determines the morphology, composition, configuration of powders, and the operating parameters of the laser sintering process as well as microstructures and properties of laser-sintered composite materials [33]. In Fig. 3b and c, nanofillers and chopped short-fibers in the length range of 50–150 μm can be applied in SLS as a flow agent and reinforcement of functionality, respectively [33,68,69]. However, they offer only modest improvements on the mechanical performances and exhibit negative impacts in some cases because of agglomeration of nanofillers and poor adhesion between fibers and polymer matrices. 2.2.2.Multiple jet fusion MJF construct 3D objects based on the layer-by-layer powder-fusion system through recoating powders and selectively dispensing antifusion and fusion agents (Fig. 4) [38,70]. Fusion agents enable to effectively absorb infrared energy to accelerate powder melting and fusion. Anti-fusion agents are dispensed around the targeted region of powder fusion to minimize the heat affected zone, in order to ensure the dimensional accuracy and complex features of designed components [37]. To date, polypropylene and polyamides such as PA12 and PA11 are the main categories of thermoplastics, which are used in the MJF system [71]. Meanwhile, these polymeric composite powders or mixed polymer/fiber powders in SLS are also applicable in the MJF process as feedstock materials [37]. The fusion agents dispensed through a voxel-by-voxel system offer the opportunity to color the voxelated material blocks and enable more functionalities by tailoring the material formulation of fusion agents. 2.2.3.Binder jetting Binder jetting is a well-established powder-based AM technique to build 3D components using different combinations of plastic binders and powders (Fig. 5) [66]. Its products are generally composed of polymers and other types of materials such as ceramics, glass, and carbon materials. In principle, materials in powder form can be applied as feedstock materials in binder jetting, however, the critical factor to ensure the successful fabrication of 3D components is the formulation of the liquid binder (Fig. 5) [72]. Water-based binders, polymer solution binders, and phosphoric and citric acid-based binders are the main categories of binder materials [72,73]. To date, binder jetting has been widely used to prepare sand molds and prototypes, and a few research efforts are devoted to composite development in recent years. 2.3.Photopolymerization-based process Photopolymerization-based processes, including stereolithography, S. Yuan et al. digital light process, Polyjet, or inkjet are available to manufacture polymeric composites to form the short fiber- and continuous fiber- reinforced composites as well as voxelated and multimaterial composites [53]. The photopolymerization-based processes generally employ UV-curable photopolymers such as epoxy and acrylic resins as feedstock materials [53]. The high flowability and excellent wetting effect of liquid photopolymers are observed upon the layer-by-layer deposition process. Thus high resolution and dimensional accuracy are achievable by formulating fast-curable resins and precisely controlling the process parameters [74]. As the stringent requirements in terms of viscosity, flowability, polymerization rate, and post-curing are raised for the development of suitable photopolymers, the addition of nanomaterials, short fibers, and continuous fibers upon printing processes are still facing large challenges to achieve stable and high-performance composite manufacturing [43,75]. 2.3.1.Vat polymerization Stereolithography is a vat polymerization technique in which UV- laser light is controlled by a lens system to modulate the scanning path so as to selectively cure the liquid photopolymer resins according to the pre-programmed patterns based on CAD-model as shown in Fig. 6a [22,76,77]. The quality of the final product depends on different parameters, such as the intensity of the laser, laser exposure, curing duration, scanning speed, and process resolution [78]. On the other hand, the digital light process also uses a UV source to cure the photoresin layer-by-layer, however, the UV light with the desired pattern is projected on the bottom surface of the liquid vat and polymerization occurs at the interface of resin and solidified green part. To date, short and continuous fibers blending with photoresin are introduced to enhance the matrix as shown in Fig. 6b and c [75]. The polymeric composite can be processed by post-treatment such as pyrolysis or carbonization to prepare carbon-based and ceramic composites [79]. Recently, continuous liquid interface production (CLIP) draws intensive attention, as its impressive production speed via superior polymerization is achieved by introducing the oxygen zone at the liquid-solid interface to accelerate the catalytic process [80,81]. Therefore, for Fig. 3.(a) Illustration of SLS system [22]; (b) microstructure of CNT/PA12 powders and the laser-sintered nanocomposite [69]; (c) microstructure of PA12 coated fibers and short carbon-fiber-reinforced composites via SLS [33]. Fig. 4.(a) Process procedures of MJF [38]; (b) strain-stress curves of printed specimen via MJF [38]; (c) and (d) microstructures of feedstock powders and printed materials [38]; (e) and (f) 3D auxetic lattices via MJF [38]. S. Yuan et al. SLA, DLP, and CLIP processes, the photopolymer resins and their composites, which can create new functionalities and exhibit superior performances are becoming merging techniques [80,82]. 2.3.2.Material jetting process PolyJet is a well-commercialized AM technique in which liquid photopolymer resins are deposited in droplet form through a series of parallel printheads (Fig. 7b) [34]. In principle, the materials used for green parts and support structures are selectively dropped on the building platform and cured by UV light immediately [83]. The precise droplets can be generated and deposited to ensure the accuracy and delicate features of printed components [84]. Notably, these cured polymers in PolyJet can exhibit different mechanical performances from soft elastomer to highly stiff thermoset. Due to the voxel-by-voxel printing manner, as shown in Fig. 7c [34], the digitalized and materialized polymeric composites can be well customized and manufactured by PolyJet and significantly improve the degree of design and manufacturing freedom [83,85]. Inkjet system is newly introduced for the preparation of thermoset/ continuous fiber composite through a dynamic capillary-driven AM process [86]. Epoxy with catalysts in liquid form is dropped onto the continuous fiber buddle and then gradually cured by external thermal energy. The processing speed is highly dependent on the curing dynamics of the thermoset, while the liquid resin is able to pre-impregnate the dry buddle and then lock carbon fibers in the polymeric matrix (Fig. 7a) [86]. Compared with thermoplastic/continuous fiber composites via AM, this composite via dynamic capillary-driven AM shows a relatively high packing factor of carbon fiber and fewer interface defects or voids. Therefore, such thermoset composite shows superior mechanical performance over other composites via AM. 2.4.Alternative and hybrid process Alternative or hybrid approaches for continuous fiber-reinforced composites have been reported to overcome the interlayer bonding, improve the loading ratio of fibers as well as avoid defects between beads and layers in FFF [30,87]. For instance, two robots are employed to hybrid AFP and AM processes to fabricate 3D polymeric composites with complex geometries [45]. The robotic-facilitated AM enables extend building volume and integrates with other production processes such as inspection, machining, surface polishing, and welding. Meanwhile, LOM, a well-known AM approach, coupled with laser cutting and laser-assisted bonding is developed to construct 3D objects using unidirectional prepreg composite tapes [30]. Although the design freedom of the LOM process might be compromised, the excellent interlayer bonding strength and the high-volume ratio of continuous fibers in composites enable the unprecedented mechanical strength of polymeric composites via AM technique. 2.4.1.Automated fiber placement & AM The continuous fiber-reinforced composites with customized complex geometry are possibly resolved by a hybrid manufacturing process that integrates AM and AFP technologies [31]. So far, the current research is exploring a hybrid system that combines AFP and AM using a collaborative robotic workcell. In the current system, AM technique offers the advantage to build a structure on which the AFP robot lays the prepreg tows up, so as to improve the design and production workflow of composite components (Fig. 8b and e) [45]. The robotic facilitated Fig. 6.(a) Illustration of digital light process [22]; (b) and (c) short and continuous fiber-reinforced composites and its tensile specimens [75]; (d) tensile property of glass fiber-reinforced composite via DLP [75]; (e) mechanical properties of raw polymer, short and continuous fiber-reinforced composites [75]. Fig. 5.(a) and (b) microstructures of powder used in binder jetting [72]; (c) and (d) microstructures of fused composites [72]; (e) schematic procedures of binder jetting [72]. S. Yuan et al. workcell enlarges the workspace of AFP and simplify the trajectory planning as well as improve the production efficiency as compared with other AM approach for composite fabrication such as FFF. The main challenges to fuse AFP and AM technologies are (1) precise control of toolpath planning and complex motion sequences for the collaborative AM and AFP processes; (2) compatible combination of depositing materials including thermoplastic or thermosetting prepreg composite materials for AFP and printable structural polymers such as PEEK, PEI, and epoxy for AM processes [44,45,88]. 2.4.2.Laminated object manufacturing LOM for continuous fiber reinforced composites have been developed recently. The prepreg composite sheets are shaped by laser cutting based on the pre-programmed computer-aided design and then the layer-by-layer bonding process is facilitated by infra radiation for efficient consolidation of prepreg sheets (Fig. 8a and c) [30,89,90]. Thermoplastic and thermo-curable thermosetting prepreg sheets are employed as feedstock materials in LOM, the production time could be significantly reduced for potential commercial applications in aerospace, automobile, marine, etc. Although the complexity of 3D models is limited by the laminated process, the controllable fiber alignment could further enhance the flexibility of microstructures of printed composites so as to add a new degree of freedom for the engineering design of composite structures (Fig. 8d) [30]. The AM techniques offer the opportunity to engineer the materials and structures across scales as shown in Fig. 9. The relationships of process-structure-performance of composites in the hierarchy are addressed in different types of additively manufactured components to reveal the potential functionalities and applications. To design the materials and structures in different scales is helpful to realize the corresponding functionality as illustrated in Fig. 10. For instance, thermal and electrical conductivities, and magnetic properties are usually determined by electron and phonon transportation as well as their polarization. Therefore, the nanostructure and compositions of printed materials influencing electron and phonon transportation are the critical factors to monitor these specific functionalities. On the other hand, mechanical properties are often associated with structures of constitutive materials from the nanoscale up to mesoscale, meanwhile, the structural design in the macroscale is also significant for the optimization of mechanical properties for printed components. Thereafter, AM techniques are employed to engineer the 3D configurations of materials and structures, especially for functional composites. In nanoscale, material compositions and filler distributions are tailorable through modifying the addition of nanofillers and nanostructure of feedstock materials. Usually, nano-additives are introduced into the polymeric matrix with random networks in 3D [70,76,79], it is challenging to artificially design nanofiller distribution or manufacture nanostructure due to the limited resolution and accuracy of types of AM processes. Only laser-assisted stereolithography such as two-photon polymerization exhibits the ultrahigh-resolution being able to fabricate the artificial structures with high complexity [101]. Bauer et al. demonstrated that pyrolysis of polymeric microlattices via two-photon polymerization can overcome the limitations of process resolution and create ultra-strong glassy carbon nanolattices with a diameter of a single strut as small as 200 nm [89]. In microscale, the microstructures of short fiber- and long fiber- reinforced composites are determined by the factors of process type, printing path, configuration, and loading ratio of fibers. For the extrusion-based process, a strong shearing force induced by the interfacial friction between melted resin and printing nozzle is able to drive the alignment of short fibers during the deposition process [41,58]. The printing path also contributes to engineering the spatial arrangement of fibers within the matrix especially for continuous fiber alignment [35]. For the powder-based and liquid-based processes, the fibers are usually distributed randomly within the polymer matrix because the fibers are homogenously pre-mixed with the feedstock materials such as thermoplastic powders [39] and photopolymers [100]. DIW and normal stereolithography exhibited relatively high resolution up to micrometer and submicrometer, respectively. Therefore, lightweight cellular structures and mechanical metamaterials were fabricated by these processes showing excellent stiffness and strength [58,100,102]. In mesoscale, patterning strategy or printing path is the key factor to engineer the 3D fiber arrangement and different phase distribution within polymeric composites. Particularly, the laminated structures via Fig. 7.(a) Design schematic of the dynamic capillary-driven thermoset/continuous carbon fiber composite and the graded distribution of temperature, resin viscosity, contact angle, and resin absorption coefficient along the carbon fibers [86]; (b) illustration of the printing head of PolyJet [34]; (c) the multi-level of composite via PolyJet with improved impact resistance [34]. S. Yuan et al. AFP or LOM can be achieved through digitally programming the continuous fiber alignment in a layer-by-layer manner [44,45]. The inter-fiber space, interlayer space, and fiber orientation significantly influence the mechanical properties and anisotropy of long fiber-reinforced composites. Apart from the laminated structure, the voxelated structures via DIW and PolyJet are also achieved through controlling the patterning strategy of multiple-phase materials in mesoscale [85]. The multi-material process for fabricating voxelated matter enables to enhance the complexity and possibility of tunable mechanical performance [23]. In macroscale, computer-aided design that conventional approach is applied to construct the 3D structures and complex components consisting of different types of materials, which can be only fabricated by AM techniques. In recent years, intensive researches are devoted to the structural design field from TO and AM, through which the design and manufacturing freedoms are fully exploited [91]. The functionally graded cellular structures and groups of lattices are optimized and feasibly printed by types of AM processes to achieve engineerable mechanical performance [92,93]. To date, the new design principle has been driven by artificial intelligence (AI) coupled with the unique advantages of AM, which is providing an inspiring approach to design digitalized materials or composite structures with advanced machine learning algorithms [24,94–97].

Fig. 9.Process-structure-property relationship corresponding to different processes and properties across the range of nano, micro, meso and macroscales. The resolution constraints of processes are indicated and the functionalities are tailorable with the range of structure scale. S. Yuan et al. 3.Design for additively manufactured polymer composites AM processes have significantly enlarged the design freedom of polymer composites. Specifically, they enable the fabrication of polymeric composites with multiscale complexities. The PSPP relationship is required for the design of AM-enabled materials and AM-driven structures. The frame of PSPP relationship is as summarized in Fig. 11. AM- enabled material designs including random distribution, fiber alignment, and voxelated arrangement of material distribution are emphasized in Section 2. AM-driven structure design covers computational optimization, computer-aided multiscale design and modeling, and bioinspired design approach. These approaches primarily target specific functionality or performance. Function-oriented classification is proposed and discussed in Section 3, including mechanical performance, electrical or electromagnetic properties, thermal performance, and acoustic performance [98,99]. 3.1.Mechanical property driven design Comparing to conventional monolithic (unreinforced) materials, composite materials can be designed to achieve unprecedented mechanical properties, and that can be tailored for a wide range of applications. In addition to that, by taking advantage of the design freedom enabled by AM, the computational optimization-based design method can be applied to the different design scales, which can further improve the performance of designed composites structures. In this sub-section, those available design methods for mechanical properties will be further divided into two sub-categories and respectively discussed. </a><br><br><a id="s8" onmouseover="over('s8', 'r8')" onmouseout="out('r8')">3.1.1.Stiffness/strength </a><br><br><a id="s9" onmouseover="over('s9', 'r9')" onmouseout="out('r9')">Stiffness and strength are two primary design targets for most mechanical parts and components. Several design and optimization methods on different scales have been developed to further enhance the mechanical performance of AM fabricated composites. Specifically, on macroscale, like other AM fabricated materials, structural optimization such as size, shape, and TO methods can be applied to guide product design [100,101]. Among them, AM-driven TO can maximize the potential of the polymeric composite [91]. The unique manufacturing constraints, for instance, connectivity and minimum size were limited in TO problem to ensure structural manufacturing ability [102]. Zhou et al. [103] presented a simple side constraint scheme combined with void features to ensure connectivity, restraining the enclosed cavity in optimal results. Yang et al. [104] captured gradient-based minimum length accurately to constrain structural size according to the minimum voxel size. Even though these approaches are not specifically designed for polymeric composites fabrication, they are still effective since the unique manufacturing constraints of AM fabricated polymers can be easily considered in these approaches. Besides manufacturing constraints, the anisotropic material property [105] is another factor that needs to be considered during the design and optimization of polymeric composites, especially for those fiber-reinforced composites. Wu et al. [106] optimized the solid shell and the non-uniform porous infill so as to arrange the macrostructure and long fiber orientation simultaneously. The result shows non-uniform infill structure performs much stiffer than the uniform infill since all the fibers follow the principal stress direction. Li et al. [107,108] integrated the orientation-dependent material function into TO and achieved Fig. 10.Structural design in multiple scales and phases of composite with spatial distribution in 2D and 3D. Fig. 11.A framework of PSPP in polymeric composites via AM. S. Yuan et al. mechanical improvement in stiffness (8.9%) and strength (14.3%) owing to taking advantage of the layer-by-layer building process-induced anisotropy. In FFF, the direction of filament alignment controls anisotropy and it determines the maximum strength. Considering this anisotropy, the deposition path and self-support structure were optimized by level set-based TO Ref. [109]. For multi-axis FFF, the curved sliced layers can be generated by the distribution of principal stress with the help of the filed-based methodology [110]. Compared to the models fabricated by planar layer, the reinforced structures show 600% mechanical strength in experimental verification. These works are generally suitable for composite polymer printing regardless of raw material. However, it should be noted most existing methods still use the constitutive model of the composite materials fabricated by conventional manufacturing approaches. This model cannot fully characterize the relationship between the microstructures of 3D printed composites such as fiber orientation and their mechanical properties like stiffness and strength. Thus, the material constitutive model [111] which has been specifically designed for 3D printed composites should be used in future research. On mesoscale, structural designs usually include path planning of continuous fiber in polymeric matrices, the cellular/lattice topology, and the digitalized design approach for voxelated matters [23, 112–114]. Specifically, the topologized structure [115] with 3D path planning is attractive for continuous fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) as shown in Fig. 12. The reinforcements are aligned with the directions of force transfer and then strengthened the stress-intensive regions by the topologized alignment of continuous fibers [115]. The dynamic capillary-driven approach is newly introduced to fabricate the composite structure using thermoset resin and continuous fibers. It can be observed that liquid resin can fully wet the fiber bundles and simultaneously cured to form compact microstructures, more importantly, the spatial arrangement of continuous fiber can be easily engineered to build the freestanding structures as shown in Fig. 13b [86]. Moreover, the lattice designs exhibited inaccessible properties in nature and are known as metamaterials. These metamaterials possess unique functional performances such as ultrahigh strength/stiffness, zero or negative Poisson’s ratio, high bulk modulus [116,117]. As shown in Fig. 13. Wang et al. utilized multi-material 3D printing techniques to fabricate the main disc structure of high-performance bioinspired robotic systems [118]. Lakes et al. [119] introduced negative-stiffness inclusions to ferroelastic vanadium dioxide so as to achieve high composite stiffness. Tailorable Poisson’s ratio is available by the structural topology of mechanical metamaterials, which can be fabricated by dip-in 3D direct-laser-writing optical lithography [120]. Dual-phase material with short carbon fiber is employed to prepare lightweight lattice structures, which exhibited tailorable mechanical stiffness and damping dispassion as shown in Fig. 13 (a) [121]. Besides mesoscales, designers can also directly control the microstructures of constitutive materials to achieve the desired mechanical properties and performance. For example, inverse homogenization [122] can be applied to generate the microstructures of AM fabricated digital composites with the given desired mechanical or thermal properties. Besides that, machine learning [97] or bio-inspired approaches [34,123,124] can also be applied to find the microstructures of AM fabricated polymeric composite with desired mechanical properties such as high toughness or impact resistance. Instead of the design and fabrication of homogeneous composite materials, functional gradient composites [125,126] can also be designed and fabricated to achieve the desired deformation distribution. It should be noted that with the rapid development of advanced AM processes, the border between different design scales is vague, which means more and more multiscale design and optimization methods such as concurrent optimization approaches [127] are proposed. These methods can consider the design freedom on multiple design scales. Thus, the mechanical performance of designed parts can be further improved. However, it should also be noticed that there are still certain limitations of those existing multi-scale design approaches. Firstly, the manufacturability constraints cannot be fully addressed. Particularly, the constraints on different design scales are different. They all need to be fully considered during the design process. The second major issue is the lack of accurate simulation tools, which can efficiently predict the performance of parts made of composites with multi-scale complexities. Conventional modeling techniques for composites, such as the homogenization approach [128], are no longer efficient and effective for those Fig. 12.(a) Analyzed element density of the tensile specimen [115]; (b) element density and printing path of the three-point bending specimen [115]; (c) topological analyzing process of the suspension plate [115]; (d) a printing path of the suspension plate, and (e) the 3D printed suspension plate [115]. S. Yuan et al. AM fabricated composites with functionally graded microstructures. It is difficult to find the RVE inside those composites where periodic boundary conditions can be directly applied. Lastly, process parameters of AM fabricated polymeric composites are not fully considered during the design stage. By controlling the process parameters, the microstructures of composites can be further optimized. It will further enlarge the design freedom of AM fabricated polymeric composites. 3.1.2.Energy absorption and damping Composites exhibit advantageous performances on damping and energy absorption due to their hard phase retaining mechanical strength and relatively soft phase being able to dissipate mechanical energy upon external cyclic loading or shock impact [19,129]. Meanwhile, the spatial arrangement of hard and soft phases can help to guide force distribution and induce force dissipation [130,131]. Therefore, AM technologies provide unpredictable potential in the design and manufacturing-freedom of composite material/structure for damping and energy absorption applications [11,38,132]. Additively manufactured composite possesses tunable energy absorption performance by optimizing constituent material and structural design across multiple scales. The high capacity of energy absorption, programmable mechanical behaviors, and reconfigurability are desirable properties in AM-driven design. Usually, the expected energy absorption of structural composite requires features including tough constitutive materials, dual/multiple phase materials with varied mechanical stiffness, flexible nodes or connection in structure, and large volume deformation upon loading. To investigate the potential of destructive energy absorption for cellular structures, quasi-static energy absorption of six types of lattice composites via MJF was evaluated [38]. The results show that lattice structures with bend-dominated deformation exhibit low stiffness and strength but provide relatively high energy absorption capacity and efficiency as compared with stretch and buckling dominated structures. In another study, the integration of high-performance nanocomposites and Fig. 13.(a) The effect of soft phase on the bulk CFRP stiffness-damping properties of short carbon fiber reinforced thermoset composite lattice [121]; (b) capillary force-driven 3D printed thermoset/continuous carbon fiber composite with excellent mechanical stiffness and strength [86]. Fig. 14.(a–g) The composite structures from the nanoscale to macroscale and the compressive energy absorption upon loading [11]; (h) the energy absorption capacity versus relative density of auxetic lattices as compared with stochastic foam [11]; (i) Ashby map of energy absorption capacity versus density of 3D-printed materials/structures [11]. S. Yuan et al. 3D auxetic metamaterials via SLS reveals the excellent static energy absorption capacity induced by the buckling-dominated deformation manner [11]. This is because the fabricated auxetic metamaterials combined the advantageous mechanical performance rooting in constituent materials and structural geometry as shown in Fig. 14. The networking of CNTs strengthened PA12 matrix in nanoscale achieving outstanding toughness, and 3D buckling-crystal auxetic lattice possesses excellent volumetric contraction upon compression in macroscale [133]. Notably, bending-dominated or buckling-dominated structures exhibit a highly compliant manner, which promotes their energy absorption upon external compression. The additively manufactured composites can be created with a tailored microstructure and engineerable meso/macro cellular structures, which reveal the superior performance of energy absorption over a wide range of materials including stochastic foams, metallic/plastic honeycombs, etc. Apart from structural lattices composing of the nanocomposite, continuous fiber-reinforced PLA via FFF was employed to fabricate the 2D auxetic lattices with improved compressive stiffness and energy absorption by 86.3% and 100%, respectively [113]. This is because the continuous fibers embedded in the polymeric matrix can prohibit crack propagation and strengthen the structural composite with a negative Poisson ratio. Moreover, dual-material auxetic metamateirals via Polyjet exhibit designable auxeticity because their Poisson ratios are determined by their constituent materials and geometrical parameters of a unit cell, and thus their energy absorption is tunable by these design factors [130]. In order to produce tough and damage-tolerant composites with programmable property, Lewis et al. formulated groups of composites available to DIW. For instance, architectural lattices via extruding flexible core and brittle shell motifs in 3D exhibit their outstanding crack resistance and energy dissipation [134]. The rotational DIW technique was applied to manage the fiber orientation distribution within the polymeric matrix and then provide a solution in micro/mesoscale to minimize interfacial defects and crack propagation [35,131]. To improve the impact resistance of composite performance, the hierarchical design principle is introduced to fabricate a bioinspired composite via PolyJet, and a biomimetic conch shell’s multiscale microstructure possesses soft and stiff constituents with cross-lamellar hierarchy [34]. This work reveals that the mechanism of impact resistance of conch shell is to generate pathways of crack propagation across different levels. On the other hand, the impact absorption of biomimetic hyperbolic lattices was also investigated by varying the design factors of unit cell geometry and assembly strategies such as body-centered cubic unit and hexagon-type unit [10]. The twisted deformation evolution results in the apparent buffering effect upon drop-impact testing. In Fig. 15, continuous-fiber reinforced composites also exhibit excellent impact resistance by designing their pattern via sinusoidal path and angle in 3D [129]. This is because the fracture crack propagation is dragged by the continuous fiber. To investigate the feasibility of AM-fabricated composite for damping application, viscoelastic polymer via DIW and soft TPU via SLS/FFF is introduced as reversible and reconfigurable materials to build architectural damper [51]. The highly recoverable and periodically compression responsive behaviors are observed in the viscoelastic soft polymeric structures [135,136]. However, few composites via AM are fabricated for mechanical damper, and this may be due to the poor interfacial adhesion and process-induced defects within polymeric composites, which shows inferior fatigue resistance upon cyclic loading [102]. In summary, to understand the fundamentals of process-structure- property relationship across multiple scales is crucial to take the advantages of constituent materials and structures in the hierarchy. It can be generalized to the design of future protective apparatus with desirable compressive stress, optimal energy absorption capacity, and damping response. 3.2.Electrical and electromagnetic properties 3.2.1.Electrical conduction Electrical properties such as conductivity are usually influenced by the material formulation, the distribution of fillers, and interfacial adhesion of filler/matrix within composites in nano to microscale. To date, the conductive phases usually include carbon-based materials, metallic particles, and conductive polymers, which are blended with thermoplastics and then processed by SLS, FFF, MJF, etc. The electron paths are generated by the interconnected 3D network of conductive additives. Yuan et al. proposed a solution-precipitation approach to prepare the CNTs coated PA12 and TPU powders, which can be used in SLS to fabricate polymeric composites with an electrically conductive segregated network [69]. Li et al. used this approach to prepare the flexible CNT/TPU composite to fabricate the electrical strain sensor [137]. In addition, the conductive filaments with the addition of Fig. 15.(a) The illustration of debonding region of continuous fiber with PLA phases [129]; (b) energy absorption of continuous fiber reinforced composite respect to its sinusoidal angle [129]; (c) demonstration of printing process of composite with 3D sinusoidal pattern [129]; (d–f) illustration of pattern planning of continuous fiber in 3D [129]. S. Yuan et al. graphene, CNTs, or carbon fiber are prepared as feedstock materials for FFF, and the printed parts exhibited excellent mechanical performance and electrical conductivity [138]. The photosensitive resin mixed with conductive additives of CNTs is utilized as feedstock materials to fabricate the functional parts with the electrically anti-static performance [137]. Moreover, groups of conductive inks were developed for DIW and droplet printing processes. The conductive path can be directly created by patterning of the nozzle head. The patterning strategy of conductive paths significantly influences the functionality and performance of printed devices. Silver/copper nanoparticles and carbon nanomaterials [139] are functionalized with surfactants and dispersed into a solvent to prepare the printable ink. The conformal printing strategy is applied to integrate the conductive path with functional devices or components, such as antenna, strain sensor, and pressure sensor as shown in Fig. 16 [62,140–143]. Additionally, the conductive inks can also be printed on the flexible surface to support the development of flexible electronics. For instance, the graphene or CNT blended with polymer additives can be printed as anode of Li-ion battery with 3D configuration, instead of conventional layer-wise fabrication of electrode [90,144]. The path design and distribution of conductive materials in mesoscale can create unique electrical functions, for instance, the 3D-printed antenna can customize its bandwidth and frequency range. The sensitivity of strain or pressure sensor can be monitored by controlling the path design and bead size of printing materials [65]. Furthermore, the continuous fiber-reinforced composite via AM exhibits their unique advantage to create a highly conductive path along with fiber orientation. Therefore, the conductive path in 3D can be directly engineered by the patterning strategy to reinforce the electrical conductivity of composite by tuning the continuous fiber arrangement within the matrix. In short, the electrical conduction of composite can be engineered in different scales as well. The addition of nano or micro conductive additives is an effective approach to modify the material formulation and change the microstructure of printed composite in nano/microscale. On the other hand, the conductive path planning and arrangement of continuous fiber in meso/macroscale also show their advantages in device fabrication and electrical performance in anisotropy. In advance, multifunctional integration of 3D-printed device will extend the composite concept to materialized composition in digitalized spatial arrangement. Electrical property especially conductivity must be addressed in functional device development as most information needs to be converted to electrical signal to communicate with the external environment. 3.2.2.Electromagnetic shielding In recent years, electromagnetic metamaterials that artificial structures offer extraordinary interactions with incident waves, which are not accessible by natural materials [145]. These materials usually possess negative refraction index [146], tunable wave absorption [14,147], interference shielding [13], cloak effects [148], etc. They are strongly demanded for imaging, sensing, electromagnetic shielding, stealth materials, and non-destructive detection [149,150]. The special material composition and structural configuration are the key factors to realize the functionalities of electromagnetic metamaterials [13]. Therefore, intense scientific attention is devoted to the additively manufacturable composite material/structure to achieve desirable properties such as wideband wave absorption and high absorptivity [64,151]. The magnetic-dielectric type [229] and electric-dielectric type wave absorbers [152] are usually composite materials consisting of magnetic polarized/dielectric phase and conductive/dielectric phase, respectively. The material compositions and their microstructures significantly influence the magnetic loss, dielectric loss, and impedance math. Meanwhile, the structural electromagnetic metamaterials/wave absorbers possess engineerable and periodic macrostructures that can effectively monitor the impedance match and the electromagnetic parameters of composites [153]. For instance, FFF process was employed to fabricate the graphene composite [64], continuous CF/PLA composite [151], and honeycomb composites [154]. In Fig. 17, the printed graphene composites with 3D structural grids exhibit improved electromagnetic wave absorptivity (>90%) in a wideband of 8–18 GHz once the loading of graphene increases beyond 4 wt% [64]. The shielding effectiveness of CF/PLA is highly process-dependent and it was achieved in the ranges of 25.1–69.9 dB, 51.1–75.6 dB, and 6.8–78.9 dB by tailoring the number of layers (2–12), hatch spacing (1.6–0.8 mm), and filling angle (90◦–0◦), respectively [151]. In addition, the metamaterial absorber via honeycomb composite was fabricated by integrating 3D-printed plastic dielectrics, resistive patches, and conductive copper backboard. This absorber can realize wide and high absorptivity in the band of 3.53–24 GHz and sharp absorption peaks are observed at the frequencies of 3.82 GHz, 11.78 GHz, and 19.21 GHz [154]. Based on a similar mechanism that high absorption across a wide range of frequency is strongly Fig. 16.(a–d) The conductive path via DIW is created to fabricate functional devices [140]; (e–f) demonstration of graphene composite array via DIW and (g–h) microstructure of printed graphene layers [141]; (i) conduction testing of graphene composites composing of GO and RGO [141]; (j) illustration of the assembly mechanism of printed graphene layers [141]. S. Yuan et al. associated with electric excitation on the conductive plastic surface, a wideband and polarization-insensitive metamaterial was developed by a hybrid process of FFF and patterning of conductive phase [155]. SLS was also employed to fabricate the structural composite consisting of ferromagnetic materials and PA12, which exhibited a wideband absorption effect in the range of 4–18 GHz. Moreover, Yin et al. reported that a gradient-refractive-index metamaterial was manufactured by SLA to form an electromagnetic wave cloak [156]. Mei et al. developed an Al2O3/SiCw composite through chemical vapor infiltration on the SLA-printed Al2O3 structure, and this composite shows an effective absorption bandwidth ranging from 8.2 to 12.4 GHz and reaches the minimum reflection coefficient value of 􀀀63.65 dB absorption at 9.8 GHz [153]. 3.3.Thermal conduction and expansion Thermal conduction and expansion are two typical thermal properties, which can be monitored or engineered through designing the material formulation and microstructural architectures. The thermal conductive or insulative composites via AM are attractive categories of materials/structures for thermal management and protection in aerospace, electronics, etc. [157]. Additionally, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of AM-fabricated composite structure is tunable by synthesizing and optimizing the microstructural architectures that may possess extreme or unusual thermal expansion properties (e.g. zero and negative coefficients of expansion) [158,159]. The thermal conductivity of additively manufactured components is associated with phonon propagation within the polymeric matrix. However, the common polymers exhibit highly intrinsic thermal resistance due to the phonon energy dissipation by cross-linked polymer chains. The thermal conductive fillers, including continuous carbon fibers, (CNTs) and graphene-based materials are introduced to create the interconnected network so as to reinforce the thermal conduction of composite. The thermal insulative materials/structures via AM attracted intensive attention for thermal management in electronic devices. Usually, the electrically conductive composites also show relatively high thermal conductivity, however, the laser-sintered CNT/PA12 or CNT/TPU with anti-static behavior exhibited thermally insulative performance due to the poor interfacial affinity prohibits phonon propagation [69,160]. In addition, the highly compressible 3D periodic graphene aerogel microlattice shows relatively high electrical conduction whereas it might be used as an excellent thermal insulator or resistor due to its highly stochastic porous structure as shown in Fig. 18 [157,161]. For instance, A DIW protocol was employed to create miniaturized silica aerogel objects by printing silica sol, which is gelled in an ammonia atmosphere. The created aerogel retains a high specific area and ultralow thermal conductivity [157]. The metamaterials with zero/negative CTE is designed by dual/ multiple phases TO and fabricated by dual material SLA or Polyjet [17, 159]. Sigmund et al. reported that the three-phase optimization topology can be utilized to design materials with extreme thermal expansion in early 1996. With the development of multi-material AM techniques, the materials with different CTEs can be digitally constructed composite structures with a special design of microstructural units. Xu et al. demonstrated stretch-dominated bi-material unit cells with low and high-CTE, these cells are assembled as diamond shaped building blocks of hierarchical lattices [159]. The CTE and structural performance of lattices are tunable by engineering the composition of constituent material, design of the unit cell, and assembly principle of the building block. The achieved range of CTE can be enlarged by 66% through the increasing hierarchy by one order as shown in Fig. 19. In addition, the 3D lattice by dual material stereolithography exhibits isotropic thermal contraction upon heating. Its effective expansion ratio reaches negative six as environmental temperature increases to 500 K in Fig. 19 (c) [17]. To date, materials with negative CTEs are seldom observed in nature, and the elasticity of thermoelastic material is coupled with temperature. These composites show the potential application in high-performance sensors and actuators. 3.4.Acoustic property driven design Additively manufactured structures with complex geometries, free patterns, and meticulous details exhibit the high potential in acoustic applications, including absorption, filtration, modulation, and diffraction of acoustic waves [12,162,163]. Advances in manufacturing technology enable to fabricate the acoustic device across the scales from mesoscale to macroscale, consequently, the acoustic wave from ultrasound to infrasound [163]. The AM technologies based on polymeric materials and their composites such as SLS, SLA, and FFF are exploited to investigate the feasibility of acoustic application [12,164,165]. Godbold et al. [166] firstly evaluated the potential application of AM technique in acoustic absorbers to solve the design limitation and manufacturing constraints, which improve the performance of acoustic devices. Acoustic absorption and filtration are typical properties, which requires to attenuate the acoustic energy of discrete frequencies or wide Fig. 17.(a) Graphene composite via FFF with ultrawide band absorption within 8–18 GHz [64]; (b) continuous fiber reinforced composite via FFF with electromagnetic shielding effectiveness above 40 dB within the range of 8–12 GHz [151]. S. Yuan et al. frequency range. Capillary ducts, cellular structures, lattice structures, and acoustic metamaterials are easily manufacturable to modulate and select the functional bandwidth and frequency range [167–169]. In Fig. 20b, Yang et al. [164] investigated the acoustic absorption of cellular structures based on three typical surface types (Primitive, Gyroid, and Diamond) by tuning the three geometry-related parameters (volume fraction, unit cell size, and height) in the frequency range of 2000–6000 Hz. Interestingly, metamaterials exhibit unique advantages in sound control, guide, and manipulation. They can be engineered to achieve the exact absorptivity and attenuate wave in the specific range of frequency instead of the full spectrum as is the case of traditional acoustic absorption materials [170]. Composite metamaterials based on were demonstrated with the possible applications of super-lens, ultrasonic wave focus, absorption mask, etc. [169,171]. For example, Wang et al. [172] developed two diffractive acoustic lenses with thickness equal to the secondary wavelength, flat profile, and operation in a wide bandwidth (2400–3600 Hz). Moreover, spiral acoustic meta-materials with conical channels and openings exhibit a negative acoustic refraction behavior with modest dispersion and impedance compatibility as shown in Fig. 20 [173]. 4.Perspectives and opportunities AM indeed offers large freedom for material and structure designs of polymeric composites, which exhibit advantageous applications and features as listed in Table 1. However, different types of composite possess intrinsic weaknesses induced by material constituents and fabrication processes. Therefore, AM-driven design of polymeric composite also needs to take the consideration of process constraints and material intrinsic weaknesses, so as to fully explore the future potential of additively manufactured composites in a wide range of industries. To help stakeholders further take advantage of AM fabricated polymeric composites, some emerging research topics, including digital composites, AI/Data-driven approaches, and 4D printed, recently attracted a great deal of interest and represent the future trend of research. The perspective and opportunities of those research topics will be respectively discussed in this section. 4.1.Digital composites AM is a bottom-up fabrication process. By tuning its process parameters or fabrication path, AM processes enable us to further control the meso or microstructures of composite materials digitally. It opens a new door for designers to achieve a wider range of material properties. For example, comparing to conventional CFRP with uniform fiber orientation, both stiffness and strength can be further improved by the AM fabricated CFRP with digitally controlled fiber orientation and fiber volume fraction [174]. In this paper, we named these composites whose Fig. 18.(a–d) Illustration of additively manufactured silica aerogel via DIW, and infrared images of a circuit board with neither a sink nor an insulator on the voltage regulator (RG2, f, j), with an aluminium strip as heat sink (g, k), and with both a sink and an insulator (h, l) [157]. S. Yuan et al. meso or microstructures can be digitally controlled by AM processes as digital composites. Its detailed definition is given as: Digital composite is a type of composite material whose meso or microscale structures can be accurately controlled and fabricated by digital manufacturing processes such as additive manufacturing processes. It should be noted that the concept of digital composites proposed in this paper is different from those concepts used in the previous literature. For example, Gershenfeld and Cheung [175] defined the digital composite as a type of material compromising many discrete units reversibly joined by elastic connections. Hiller and Lipson [176] believe digital material is a type of material made of digital units (voxels) arranged selectively in a 3D lattice, as opposed to analog (continuous) material commonly used in the conventional AM process. In this paper, we aim to extend this concept into a more general scope. It does not only include those voxelated digital materials defined previously but also contains conventional composites such as CFRP or randomized fiber-reinforced materials if their meso or microstructures can be digitally described and fabricated. Compared to conventional composites, digital composites have three Fig. 19.(a) Demonstration of multilevel hierarchy in bi-material lattices with high specific stiffness and unbounded thermal expansion [159]; (b) 2D microstructural architecture designs of composite unit with negative CTE [158]; (c) lightweight dual-phase metamaterials with tunable negative CTE [17]. Fig. 20.(a) Metasurface with negative acoustic diffraction index [173]; (b) acoustic wave absorber via SLA [164]. S. Yuan et al. unique characteristics which have been summarized in Fig. 21. Firstly, the microstructure of digital composite can be customized to achieve some inaccessible material properties. For example, a digital composite with bone-inspired microstructures has been designed and fabricated via the material jetting process [177]. By digitally designed its microscale pattern, the designed digital composite shows similar failure modes like cortical bone, which can amplify its toughness while keeping the balance with the material strength. In addition to a cortical bone, nacre is another popular natural materials that researchers [123,178] have followed to design the microstructure of digital composites for better toughness and fracture resistance. Besides bio-inspired approaches, algorithm-driven approaches such as inverse-homogenization [122] as well as a machine learning algorithm [97] can also be applied to the meso or microscale structures of digital composite for the tailored properties. Secondly, functional gradient digital composites can also be designed and fabricated by AM, which can further improve the performance of the fabricated structure. For example, a digital laminate composite optimization approach has been proposed by Boddeti et al. [179]. This proposed digital design flow can simultaneously update the macroscale shape of the designed laminate structure as well as the orientation of short reinforced fibers inside the geometry. Besides short-fiber reinforced composite, the functional gradient continuous fiber-reinforced laminate can also be digitally designed and fabricated by AM process. Several design approaches [115,174] have been developed to enable the control of the orientation and volume fraction of AM fabricated continuous fiber composites. Their results [115,174] have shown that the optimized functional gradient laminate can achieve better stiffness and strength compared to conventional CFRP laminate with uniform orientation angles and fiber densities. In addition to fiber-reinforced composites, other types of functional graded digital composites such as voxelated digital composite [125,180–182] can also be carefully designed for a wide range of applications. Particularly, an automated voxel-based digital composite design and fabrication approach is proposed by Ituarte et al. [65]. In this approach, pseudo-random voxel-based digital composites have been designed by a TO-based design approach to achieve the desired displacement distribution. Zhu et al. [180] have proposed a two-scale TO approach. Compared to Ituarte’s approach, this method can simultaneously update the material compositions and the topology of unit cells. Leung et al. [181] recently have proposed a tensor-based error diffusion algorithm that aims to find digital material composition in the design domain with matched mechanical properties distribution. In addition to structural performance, functional graded digital composites can also be designed for 4D printing. For example, a digital design tool called “voxel smart” [182] has been developed which enables designers to control the digital material distribution on voxel level to achieve the desired deformation after external physical activation. Thirdly, the properties of digital composites can be further improved by considering the hierarchical complexities. Many natural materials such as human bone, conch, or lobster shell are typical composite materials that are made of simple building blocks including collagen and hydroxyapatite. By combining these basic building blocks in a hierarchical manner, we can achieve a wide range of promising mechanical properties. Inspired by nature, Gu et al. [34] have designed a multiscale digital composite to simulate the conch shell. The research result shows the hierarchal digital composite can boost impact performance by 70% compared to those composites with single-level complexity. Like the design of digital material with a single scale of complexities, computational or algorithm-driven design approach [183,184] can also be applied to the digital composites with hierarchical complexities. For example, a hierarchical digital composite material has been designed by Mirzaali [183]. This digital composite is made of lattice structures on mesoscale. The strut of lattice structures is made of two different materials: soft and hard polymer. Two different design approaches are proposed to control the distribution of the material on cell scales. By using numerical simulation, the relationship between the design parameters of lattice and its properties are built. This relation can help designers to independently control the elastic modulus and Poisson ratio of designed digital composites. A similar approach has also been applied to design a programmable digital material as an actuator. The actuation force, amplitude, and mode could be selected and tuned within a wide range [184]. Even though current research shows the great promising future of digital composites, but there are still some unsolved problems that need to be further addressed. Firstly, it is hard to digitally design the part or product made of digital composite materials through existing CAD software. Most existing CAD software can only model part’s geometry based on conventional geometric modeling methods such as Boundary Representation (B-Rep) or polygon mesh. They cannot be directly used to digitally describe the distribution of microstructures of designed digital composites. To deal with this issue, some heterogeneous object modeling approaches [185,186] have been proposed.

Yuan et al. existing design routine and make them compatible and convertible to the existing CAD modeling method used in the commercial CAD software. Besides modeling, another major challenge for the digital composite design comes from its optimization. Compared to conventional composites, digital composites provide more design freedom, which means a significant increase in the number of design variables. How to efficiently select suitable digital composites and further using engineering optimization tools to get customized digital composites with the desired properties is one of the key problems that need to be solved. Conventional material selection strategy based on static libraries such as Ashby Chart [187] should be improved by considering the design freedom enabled by AM fabricated digital composites. A new adaptively material selection strategy needs to be developed. In addition to that, the numerical simulation model, which can deal with digital composites with multiscale complexities is also needed. Currently, most simulation models used for digital composites are developed based on homogenization approaches [128]. However, this approach may not be able to predict the digital composites whose microstructures with highly heterogeneous variations. The gap between the simulation result and the experimental result has been identified [180], which should be further minimized. The last challenge of the digital composite is its fabrication. It has two folds. Firstly, new hybrid AM processes need to be developed which can efficiently handle multi-types of materials such as polymer/metal, polymer/ceramic, and polymer/fiber and control their meso or microscale structures. Existing fabrication processes of digital composites such as material jetting or multi-material SLA processes can only handle different photopolymers with low glass transition temperatures. Their applications have been seriously limited. As to those fiber-based digital composites fabrication, how to freely control the fiber orientation in 3- dimensional space is still a challenge. Secondly, the process planning of digital composites fabrication also needs to be further explored. Besides the direct control of the microstructures through the deposition tool path, a new process planning approach is another possible pathway. The relationship between Process-Structure-Properties should be established which can help designers to achieve the desired microstructures by adaptively control the fabrication parameters. 4.2.AI-driven/data-driven approaches for AM fabricated polymeric composite process AI-driven or data-driven approach is another popular topic that has been widely explored in the field of AM recently [188–190]. It aims to use AI or machine learning algorithms to support design, process planning, and online process monitoring of AM processes related to polymeric composites. In this sub-section, they can be further divided into three categories (shown in Fig. 22) and discussed respectively. 4.2.1.Data-driven for AM fabricated composites design In design, data-driven approaches can be further divided into three sub-categories. In the first sub-category, the data-driven approach can be used to build the surrogate model to describe the material’s PSPP relationship. This model can be used to support the design and optimization process of polymeric composite’s microstructure and its distribution. For example, Gu et al. [97,191] has proposed an approach to find the optimal microstructures of digital composites for better fracture toughness based on the Convolution Neural Network (CNN). Another data-driven approach has been used by Yi et al. [192]. In this approach, on the embodiment design stage, the Bayesian network classifier is used as the reasoning framework to explore the design space, while the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model is used in the detailed design stage. Similar approaches have also been successfully used to predict and optimize mechanical properties [193,194] as well as thermal conductivity [195] of composites. For those approaches mentioned above, the data used to train the surrogate model is usually from the simulation model, which is relatively cheap to obtain compared to experiments. However, in some cases, when the accurate numerical simulation result is difficult to obtain, physical experiments are still needed. Data-driven approaches can also be directly used to memorize the optimal layout of the design. Several machine learning approaches such as the CNN model [196,197], Support-Vector-Regression (SVR) [198], or K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) [198] have been used to solve the TO problem. In these approaches, conventional TO methods such as Solid Isotropic Material Penalization (SIMP) or Moving Morphable Component (MMC) have been used to obtain the data point first. Then the data point will be feed into the established machine learning model and train the parameters in the model to memorize the response. Then, for a new design, it just needs to use the pre-trained model to generate the results. Comparing to the conventional TO, the trained machine learning model can generate the optimal result much faster. In the third sub-category, data-driven or machine learning models such as ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) [199] or Decision Tree [200] are built to provide more information on part manufacturability [199], AM feature/parts candidates [200,201], surface roughness [202] as well as part deformation [203]. The additional information provided by those data-driven models can further support designers to improve the functional performance of the designed structures. For example, an ANN [199] model has been used to describe the relationship between geometric parameters of lattice structures and their fabrication deviations. The result of this model has been used as the manufacturing constraints in the optimization process. Currently, most approaches in the second and third sub-category are developed for a general AM process. They can be applied to AM fabricated polymeric composites, however cannot take full consideration of the design freedom of polymeric composites has provided. Thus, more research should be devoted to extending those approaches to AM fabricated polymeric composites by considering their unique advantages and constraints. For example, in the second category, the developed AI Fig. 21.Unique Characteristics of AM fabricated digital composites (Images from [34] [178] [174]). S. Yuan et al. model should not only memorize the macroscale shape but also the microstructure distribution of fabricated composites. 4.2.2.Data-driven process planning for AM Besides design, data-driven approaches can also be applied to process planning of AM processes for polymeric composites. Particularly, the data-driven approach can be used to build a Process-Structure- Property (PSP) relationship for a given AM process and its related materials. Based on this PSP model, it is easy to find the process parameters that can achieve the desired material properties. Specifically, Barrrionuevo et al. [20] has used the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference (ANFI) system to predict the mechanical properties of 3D printed wood fiber-reinforced materials based on the process parameters such as layer thickness, filling density, raster angle, and printing speed. Based on the established model, the optimizer can be established to help users to find a set of optimal process parameters. Besides FFF based composites fabrication, the data-driven approach has also been applied to the material jetting process [204] for the fabrication of digital composites. In this research, three different data-driven models: Kriging, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Radial Basis Function (RBF) has been applied to model the relationship between the voltage applied to the print head position error. Based on this model, the process parameters can be further optimized to reduce the position error. It should be noted that most existing data-driven approaches for AM process planning only aim to find a set of universal process parameters that can deal with part with varied geometric features. However, it should be noticed that different geometric features may have different optimal process parameters. Recently, the research from Yi et al. [205] shows using different process parameters to fabricate different geometric features/manufacturable elements may further improve the mechanical properties of AM fabricated lattice structures. By varying the process parameters during the fabrication process, we can further control the distribution of microstructures, which in turn can improve the overall performance of designed structures. Even though this research is not primarily focused on polymeric composites fabrication, it provides a potential research direction on how to further improve the performance of AM fabricated composites. The integration of process planning and design on AI or data-driven approach is the future trend. It is extremely useful for AM fabricated composite whose microstructures can be fully customized by digitally controlling process parameters. 4.2.3.Data-driven process monitoring and quality control for AM Besides design and process planning, part qualification is another area where data-driven approaches can be applied. Specifically, machine learning approaches can be used to build a model to process signals from in-situ process monitoring, such as a thermal history, fabrication images, mechanical vibration, etc. The output of the machine learning approach can detect the existence of potential defects during the fabrication process. Comparing to the conventional condition-based algorithm, the machine learning model has a strong generalization ability. It can work with the process with different process parameters, materials as well as parts with different shapes. It requires fewer human operations and relies on less operator’s experience or knowledge. Currently, most existing machine learning models on in- situ process monitoring of AM are focused on the PBF (Powder Bed Fusion) processes [18,206]. They are primarily designed for metal rather than polymeric composites. But they can be easily modified to monitor the SLS fabricated short fiber composites printing. Besides PBF (Powder Bed Fusion) processes, data-driven models have also been widely used for the process monitoring of FFF processes. For example, the SVM model [207] has been trained to monitor the FFF fabrication process. In this model, the data from an accelerometer and an acoustic emission sensor has been used. Besides mechanical signals, the images collected during the fabrication are another major data source for in-situ process monitoring. Jin et al. [208] has proposed a deep-learning-based method to detect and predict the interlayer imperfections for the FFF process based on real-time processing images. The result shows the trained model can effectively predict the onset of warping and detect different levels of delamination. Even though those approaches discussed are not designed for polymeric composites, they can be easily extended to those FFF based composites fabrication by updating the data they used. In general, data-driven approaches can be applied to the different stages of AM process to support polymeric composites design, process planning, and monitoring. However, it lacks a holistic approach to link them together. From Fig. 22, it is clear that these three fields are highly coupled. Particularly, the output of AM design will affect both process planning and part qualification, while based on the feedback of part qualification, we can further adaptively tune the process parameters to make sure the quality of fabricated part can satisfy the given design requirements. These fully coupled relations enables the data collected for AM design can also be used for part qualification and process planning. The integration of different data-driven approaches and their Fig. 22.Overview of data-driven approaches for polymeric composites fabricated by AM. S. Yuan et al. related data can further help designers to improve both the performance and quality of parts. Data is another major issue for the current data-driven AM approaches. Currently, the data used are mainly from two major resources: physical experiments and numerical simulation. In most cases, physical experiments can generate data with high fidelity but expensive. In contrast, numerical simulation can generate data in an inexpensive manner. However, due to the assumption used in this simulation model, the fidelity of data is low. How to combine the numerical data and simulation data is another important area that needs to be explored in the future. 4.3.4D printing for composite design Recent advances in AM technologies enable extending the design space beyond 3D complex geometries. The potential of such a technique via 4D printing (times as the fourth dimension) allows the reconfiguration of printed structures by appropriate stimuli, including thermal, electrical, and magnetic actuation [209]. Different composite materials can be used and combined to create customized multi-functional objects to meet many needs. The various features and applications are addressed for fabricating composites via 4D printing, including reversible, reconfigurable, and recoverable properties [210,211]. The concept of 4D printing aims to develop complex composite structures without the need for complex curved molds [212]. The large opportunities and current deficiencies for the design and manufacturing of arbitrary structures are reviewed and discussed. Shape memory polymer (SMP) and shape memory alloy (SMA) are two different types of thermal-mechanical active materials that are utilized for 4D printing [213]. Qi et al. firstly demonstrated the sequential self-folding strand via PolyJet and simulated the sequential folding process of thermal stimulus-responsive composite parts composing of shape memory segments and rigid segments [214,215]. The mechanical modeling for active composite materials via 4D printing includes the crucial aspects of SMP phase transformation, hyper-elasticity, elasto-plasticity, and heating-cooling programming [216–218]. SMPs show elasto-plastic response at low temperatures while they behave hyper-elastically at high temperatures in the largely deformed regime. Yuan et al. also reported the laser-sintered auxetic lattice consisting of thermoplastic polyurethane, which exhibited excellent thermal recoverable property even if the auxetic lattice experienced a large volumetric deformation [136,219]. Another type of thermally active material of SMA can be also embedded into a polymeric matrix through FFF process and then the printed composites exhibit reversible shape-changing by a cyclic thermal loading [220]. Apart from 4D reconfiguration actuating by active materials such as SMA, SMP, and nanocomposite, the shape-changing of printed composites also can be initiated by distinct thermal-responsive performances of constituent materials in spatial. For example, Fang et al. reported that the negative CTE of a composite structure exhibited volumetric contraction over a wide range of temperatures. These composites are fabricated with a multimaterials projection SLA that enables joining two different beam constituents with one lattice structure and varying the difference of CTEs between constituent beams and geometrical arrangements [17]. The deformation of the composite structure is usually induced by the difference of CTEs between continuous fibers and flexible matrix. Wang et al. proposed to achieve a composite with programmable morphing with controllable deformation of the arbitrary deployable surface by designing the fiber trajectories [221]. Moreover, electro-mechanical, photonic-mechanical, and magnetic- mechanical smart composites are also attractive categories of contactless engineerable materials in 4D printing [222–224]. The actuation mechanism is to employ the electrical and magnetic fields or photonic waves to stimulate the responsive materials, which can convert external energy to mechanical energy so as to induce the reconfiguration of the composite structure. For instance, a composite actuator of hybrid thermoplastic/conductor bilayers is manufactured by embedding conductive wires into the flexible thermoplastic through the FFF process [210]. Such actuators can be driven towards a permanent morphing through electrical-thermal stimulation. Hua et al. also reported 3D-printed shape-changing composites, which can be employed to construct flexible paper-based photothermal bilayer actuators [225]. The photo-responsive composite is composed of PLA and multi-walled CNTs, which can effectively absorb infrared radiation and turn it into thermal energy so as to actuate the reconfigurable composite structure. Chen et al. reported that the dual self-sensing effect of thermal and strain sensors is achieved by combining nanocarbon black/PLA composites with bioinspired graded lattice structures [142]. Zhang et al. fabricated a magnetic nanoparticle/polymer composite via AM that can also respond to the magnetic field, and the printed bio-inspired structures of PLA/Fe3O4 composites with 15% Fe3O4 could be actuated by a magnetic field at 27.5 kHz [226]. Advanced control of magnetic field enables to actuate the fast transformation of 3D-printed soft composite structures with incorporating magnetics particles or embedded discrete magnets, which can generate nonuniform magnetization profiles in polymeric sheets as shown in Fig. 23. It reveals that the various functions can be derived from complex shape changes, such as reconfigurable soft robotics, mechanical metamaterials, and pharmaceutical dose [227]. Generating integrated and high-dimensional actuation systems is challenging owing to the combined complexity of creating spatial designs and developing multifunctional materials and their manufacturing as shown in Fig. 24 [228]. The upcoming actuation system employs to assign materials for individual voxel while simultaneously optimizing for physical response and high-resolution appearance. Unifying a TO-based design strategy with a multimaterial fabrication enables to create complex actuators and promote automated, goal-driven fabrication in 4D printing. Sundaram et al. proposed to unify a biomimetic evolutionary optimization with a voxelated multimaterial AM, which enables the rapid design and fabrication of high-dimensional actuators. They fabricated an untethered actuator via a 3D-printed multimaterial soft magnetic actuator, which demonstrated the strategy of multiobjective to realize the accurate control of multiple responses or functions. Therefore, multimaterial 3D and 4D printing offer unpredictable opportunities for upcoming high-dimensional design and functional integration. 5.Conclusion This review provides basic material and process knowledge of AM polymeric composite for new researchers as well as explores the emerging fields of AM-driven functional structure design, novel digital composite via AM and 4D-printed smart material, structure, and devices. The merging AM techniques for polymeric composite development are emphasized in terms of feedstock materials, process capability, and printed material properties. AM has significantly enlarged the design and manufacturing freedom of composites. To fully explore their PSPP relationship, the AM-enabled material design and AM-driven structure design approaches are addressed, as they are significant for future applications of polymeric composites. The material design of AM-enable composite is classified into three categories with random, fiber alignment, and voxelated arrangement of material distribution in multiscale. Moreover, the function-driven design is the critical motivation for structural design via AM, which covers topology optimization, computer-aided design, AI/Data-driven approach, and bioinspired approach. These newly developed multiscale and multifunctional design approaches can further improve the performance of polymeric composites fabricated by AM process and broaden its applications. Notably, digital composite via AM are newly introduced and fabricated through novel data-driven design, data-driven process planning, and data-driven process monitoring and part qualification. These techniques related to digital thread and digital twin of different polymetric S. Yuan et al. AM processes can be devoted to define the interface between different AM stages and build a holistic data-driven AM framework. It should be noted that how to holistically link the data from different AM stages and integrate data-driven approaches for design, process planning, and part qualification remain large challenges now. Another future perspective of polymeric composites is revealed the reconfiguration and remote actuation of AM-fabricated composite by external thermal energy, magnetic field, etc., so as to create 4D-printed and digitalized smart actuators.

[109]. 多軸FFFでは、ファイルドベースの方法論を用いて、主応力の分布により、湾曲したスライス層を生成することができる[110]。平面的な層で作られたモデルと比較して，強化された構造は，実験的検証において600％の機械的強度を示した。これらの研究は，原材料にかかわらず，一般に複合ポリマー印刷に適している．しかし，既存の手法の多くは，従来の製造方法で製造された複合材料の構成モデルを依然として使用していることに留意すべきである．このモデルでは、繊維配向などの3Dプリント複合材の微細構造と、剛性や強度などの機械的特性との関係を十分に評価することができない。したがって，今後の研究では，3Dプリント複合材用に特別に設計された材料構成モデル[111]を使用する必要がある．メソスケールでは、構造設計には通常、高分子マトリックス中の連続繊維の経路計画、セル/格子トポロジー、およびボクセル化された事項のデジタル化された設計アプローチが含まれる[23, 112-114]。具体的には，図12に示すように，連続繊維強化ポリマー（CFRP）では，3Dパスプランニングを用いたトポロジー化構造[115]が魅力的である。力の伝達方向に合わせて補強材を配置し、連続繊維のトポロジー化された配列によって、応力が集中する領域を強化するのです[115]。熱硬化性樹脂と連続繊維を用いて複合構造体を作製するために，動的毛細管現象を利用したアプローチが新たに導入された．液体樹脂が繊維束を完全に濡らし、同時に硬化してコンパクトな微細構造を形成することが観察できる。さらに重要なことは、図13bに示すように、連続繊維の空間的配置を容易に操作して、自立した構造を構築できることである[86]。さらに、この格子デザインは、自然界ではアクセスできない特性を示し、メタマテリアルとして知られている。これらのメタマテリアルは，超高強度/高剛性，ゼロまたは負のポアソン比，高バルク弾性率などのユニークな機能性能を有している[116,117]。図13に示すように Wangらは、マルチマテリアル3Dプリンティング技術を利用して、高性能なバイオインスパイアードロボットシステムのメインディスク構造を製作しました[118]。Lakesら[119]は、高い複合剛性を達成するために、強弾性二酸化バナジウムに負の剛性を持つ介在物を導入しました。機械的メタマテリアルの構造トポロジーにより、ポアソン比を調整することが可能であり、ディップイン方式の3次元レーザー直接描画光リソグラフィーにより製造することができる[120]。デュアル</a><br><br><a id="r10" onmouseover="over('r10', 's10')" onmouseout="out('s10')">表1 </a><br><br><a id="r11" onmouseover="over('r11', 's11')" onmouseout="out('s11')">さまざまなAMで製造された複合材料とその用途のまとめ。複合材料の種類 プロセス アプリケーション 特徴 弱点 ランダム配列（ショート/ナノ） SLA [74,75] ソフトロボット、スマートアクチュエータ、スポーツ、宇宙探査、軽量部品。-製作の容易さ -様々なタイプのAMプロセスへの高い適応性 -等方性 -繊維充填率の制限 -繊維の凝集を避けるのが難しい。Material Jetting/Polyet [84,85] SLS [4,68,84,85] Binder Jet [32,33] Continuous fiber alignment FFF [46] LOM [30] Inkjet Automated fiber placement & AM [31,45] 航空宇宙部品、軽量自動車部品、スポーツ用品、海洋構造物。電磁波シールド ・高い比剛性・強度 ・内部の繊維配向制御の自由度 ・工学的に可能な繊維体積率分布 ・低解像度 ・高い気孔率 ・層間結合性が低い ・繊維と樹脂の接着性が弱い ・3次元での繊維配置の自由度が低い 短繊維配向 DLP [80,82] FFF [59] SLA [75] SLS [33] 自動車部品。バイオメディカルデバイス、スポーツ、航空宇宙部品、電磁波吸収体 ・異方性、 ・DLP、SLA、SLS、プロセスの高い寸法精度 ・印刷方向に沿った短繊維のデジタルアライメント ・低い生産性、 ・繊維搭載率の制限 ボクセル配列 DIW [69] PolyJet [34] MJF [23] 機能性アクチュエータ。外科手術のトレーニングモデル、スマートエレクトロニクス、ソフトロボット -調整された材料特性、 -デジタル的にカスタマイズされた微細構造、 -多材料・多機能の統合 -低い生産性 -原料の厳しい要求 -複雑なプロセス計画とノズル設計 S. Yuan et al. Yuan et al.は、既存の設計ルーチンを、市販のCADソフトウェアで使用されている既存のCADモデリング手法と互換性を持たせて変換することに成功しました。モデリングの他に、デジタル複合材設計のもう一つの大きな課題は、その最適化にあります。従来の複合材と比較して、デジタル複合材は設計の自由度が高いため、設計変数の数が大幅に増えてしまいます。どのようにして適切なデジタル複合材を効率的に選択し、さらに工学的最適化ツールを使用して、望ましい特性を持つカスタマイズされたデジタル複合材を得るかは、解決しなければならない重要な問題の一つです。Ashby Chart [187]のような静的なライブラリに基づく従来の材料選択戦略は、AMで製造されたデジタル複合材によって可能になる設計の自由度を考慮して改善する必要がある。新しい適応的な材料選択戦略を開発する必要がある。それに加えて、マルチスケールの複雑さを持つデジタル複合材を扱うことができる数値シミュレーションモデルも必要である。現在、デジタル複合材に使用されているほとんどのシミュレーションモデルは、均質化アプローチに基づいて開発されている[128]。しかし，このアプローチでは，微細構造が高度に不均質に変化するデジタル複合材料を予測できない可能性がある．シミュレーション結果と実験結果の間のギャップが指摘されていますが[180]、これをさらに最小化する必要があります。デジタル複合材の最後の課題は、その製造です。これには2つの側面がある。第一に、ポリマー／金属、ポリマー／セラミック、ポリマー／繊維などの多種類の材料を効率的に扱い、それらのメソスケールまたはマイクロスケールの構造を制御できる、新しいハイブリッドAMプロセスを開発する必要がある。既存のデジタル複合材料の製造プロセスであるマテリアルジェッティングやマルチマテリアルSLAプロセスでは、ガラス転移温度の低いさまざまなフォトポリマーしか扱えない。そのため、その用途は非常に限られていました。また、繊維ベースのデジタル複合材料の製造に関しては、3次元空間における繊維の配向をいかにして自由に制御するかが課題となっています。第二に、デジタル複合材料製造のプロセス計画もさらに検討する必要がある。蒸着ツールの経路を通じて微細構造を直接制御する以外に、新しいプロセス計画のアプローチも考えられます。プロセス-構造-特性の関係を確立し、設計者が製造パラメータを適応的に制御することで、望ましい微細構造を実現できるようにする必要があります。4.2.AI-driven/data-driven approach for AM fabricated polymeric composite process AI-drivenまたはdata-driven approachは、最近AMの分野で広く検討されているもう一つの話題である[188-190]。これは、AIまたは機械学習アルゴリズムを使用して、高分子複合材料に関連するAMプロセスの設計、プロセス計画、およびオンラインプロセスモニタリングを支援することを目的としている。このサブセクションでは、それらをさらに3つのカテゴリー（図22に示す）に分けて、それぞれ説明する。4.2.1.AM加工複合材設計のためのデータドリブン 設計において、データドリブンなアプローチは、さらに3つのサブカテゴリーに分けられる。第一のサブカテゴリーでは、データ駆動型アプローチは、材料のPSPP関係を記述するサロゲートモデルを構築するために使用することができる。このモデルは、設計と最適化のプロセスをサポートするために使用することができます。</a><br>
