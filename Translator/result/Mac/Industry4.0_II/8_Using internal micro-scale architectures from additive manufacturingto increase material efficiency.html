Twogrowing areas of exploration have been the use of bio-derived plastics and the use of material efficiencyprinciples to reduce overall plastics demand. Bio-derived plastics are typically considered to be moreenvironmentally sustainable than their petroleum-based counterparts. Additionally, advances inmanufacturing technology have broadened the potential to use materials in an efficient manner bycontrolling internal structures, thus reducing dependency on solid components. The goal of this workwas to provide an initial perspective into how internal microstructures in bio-derived plastics canbroaden their range of mechanical and thermal properties, while reducing resource consumption. Todetermine the ability to influence material efficiency in this manner, poly(lactic) acid specimens weremanufactured with 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% infill percentages, using additive manufacturing to incor-porate a microscale internal octagram spiral geometry. Tensile,flexural, and thermal conductivityproperties of these plastics were compared to properties attained through conventional injectionmolding of poly(lactic) acid. Results showed the incorporation of an internal microstructure in ther-moplastics caused reductions in both tensile andflexural moduli and strength, with typical losses of 30%in tensile properties and 20% inflexural properties. Yet improvements were noted to toughness andelongation properties, as well as lower thermal conductivity with the incorporation of a complex internalstructure. Additionally, examination of specific properties of the poly(lactic) acid components and use ofAshby material indices showed the use of additive manufacturing could notably improve material effi-ciency, particularly apparent for the 25% infilled specimens. This work revealed potential improvementsto energy dissipation and ductility through unique deformation mechanisms attained by additivemanufacturing processing.©2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Coinciding with the growing popularity of plastics thereare large environmental burdens: annual greenhouse gas (GHG)emissions from plastics production exceed 1.5 Gt of CO2-eq emis-sions annually (Zheng and Suh, 2019) and the disposal ofpetroleum-based plastics has led to both economic and ecosystemdamages (Willis et al., 2018). Oceanic harm resulting from plasticwaste pollution is one of the most widely recognized environ-mental concerns, with links to large-scale threats such as diseaseoutbreak in coral reefs (Lamb et al., 2018). Additionally, oceanicpollution has resulted in substantial policy efforts and reform sur-rounding waste management and trade (Brooks et al., 2018). Bio-derived  thermoplastics  from  natural  resources  have  beenexplored as potentially more environmentally sustainable alter-natives to petroleum-based plastics (Kamau-Devers and Miller,2020). These bio-derived plastics are now widely researched ma-terials, having been identified as potential candidates for manydifferent industries where petroleum-based plastics are currentlybeing used including biomedical (Giordano et al., 1997), buildingand construction (Hager et al., 2016), automotive (Notta-Cuvieret al., 2014), and packaging applications (Armentano et al., 2013).However, currently, bio-derived plastics remain only approxi-mately 1% of the thermoplastic market (Geyer et al., 2017). As such,there is a lingering challenge in trying to understand mechanismsthat could reduce demand for high-environmental burden plastics*Corresponding author.E-mail address:kkamaudevers@ucdavis.edu(K.

Common forms of manufacturing includeextrusion processes, injection molding, or the growing area of ad-ditive manufacturing. Several aspects of polymer thermodynamicand physical properties affect printing and molding processability.For instance, molecular weight, chain configurations, and inter-molecular bonding forces each have effects on morphology andimplications on melting behavior. Additionally, properties such ascoefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) can be used to assess apolymer’s potential to crack or warp during processing as thepolymer cools (Stansbury and Idacavage, 2016). Properties such asCTE can have direct implications on manufacturing practices anddecisions, particularly for additive manufacturing. For instance,polymers with higher CTE values may deform more as they coolfrom melting temperature to ambient room temperatures (Weiet al., 2015), and so choosing a higher printing bed temperatureto decrease the nozzle-to-bed gradient may be beneficial. Semi-crystalline poly(lactic) acid (PLA) is a popular bio-derived ther-moplastic with morphological and CTE properties that permit goodprinting performance (Krotký et al., 2016); hence, many manufac-tures design printers specifically for their use (Letcher andWaytashek, 2014). PLA has also been shown to release fewertoxins upon heating in comparison to other common printingplastics such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), which isadvantageous from an environmental perspective (Wojtyła et al.,2017).Additive manufacturing allows for the choice of internal micro-scale geometry and for easy control of material anisotropy (Tayet al., 2017), whereas conventional manufacturing methods, likeinjection molding, typically allow for only solid components.Different combinations of infill percentages and geometries aredesirable to achieve higher strength-to-weight ratios (Lu et al.,2014), better ductility response (Barthelat, 2015), and overallimproved use of plastic as a resource (i.e., greater material effi-ciency). Improved use of plastic resources may lead to many ad-vantages including reductions in cost and environmental impacts.For instance, lighter components resulting from not having to useas much material, would likely require less processing time toproduce (Farbman and McCoy, 2016). Further, lighter componentswould alter transportation fuel demands, potentially allowing theuse of more fuel efficient delivery options (Davis et al., 2018). Theadvantages of additive manufacturing also span other areas in en-ergy savings. Other benefits include the potential ability to createinsulating materials (Tay et al. (2017). More specifically, alteringbulk properties, like thermal conductivity, as it varies with densityfor these materials, may provide further insights to potential en-ergy savings if used as an insulative material (Ameli et al., 2014).Robust studies examining material efficiency achieved throughuse of additive manufacturing to control the internal architecture inbio-derived polymers, such as PLA, are necessary to expand mate-rial properties achievable and mitigate resource demand. There aremany possible combinations of infill geometries and densities, soexploring and ultimately standardizing printing strategies, pro-cedures, and their results will prove highly beneficial in stream-lining future production. Several studies have been conducted tolay the groundwork for such design methodologies.Farbman andMcCoy (2016)examined tensile properties of PLA specimens hav-ing varying infill percentages and geometries, and found hexagonalpattern infills to have greater modulus and strength properties incomparison to rectilinear pattern infills. These authors also re-ported lower applied force to mass ratios for all print combinationsin comparison to 100% solid infill specimens.Letcher andWaytashek (2014)assessed tensile,flexural, and fatigue testing ofprinted PLA specimens having varying infill orientations of 0,45,and 90, and found varying results for each. For instance, the 45orientation performed best in tension while the 0orientationperformed best inflexure, and both performed similar in fatiguetesting, better than the 90orientation. Although this work illus-trated the importance of considering varying internal attributesachieved through additive manufacturing in relation to mechanicalperformance, these authors did not vary changes in infill percent-age or density to examine material efficiency by mass.Trhlikovaet al. (2016)printed PLA specimens to examine the effects of co-lor additives on thermal properties, where specimen densitiesvaried resulting from the type of color additive selected, but notfrom variations in infill architectures. While such work has beencritical to the advancement of guided design of additive manufac-tured components, there remains a paucity of literature examininghow additive manufacturing can contribute to material efficiencygoals, which have been touted as critical to meeting resourceconsumption-related mitigation goals (Allwood, 2018).The objective of this work was to examine how additivemanufacturing can expand the range of mechanical and thermalproperties of bio-derived PLA as well as relate those performancechanges to increases in efficient use of resources. To do so, com-parisons were drawn to injection molded specimens and propertyalteration was considered in conjunction with benefits attributableto changes in component density. This work provides a criticalstepping-stone to addressing a systematic methods for increasingmaterial efficiencies through controlling internal micro-scalestructures in thermoplastics.2. Materials and methods2.1. MaterialsAll test specimens were prepared using ECOMAX®PremiumPLA Biopolymerfilament from 3DXTECH. Thisfilament wasselected for its low level of additives,>99% PLA concentration resin.For the injection molded specimens, thisfilament was cut intosimilar dimensions as typical molding pellets.2.2. Specimen preparationSpecimens were prepared using two manufacturing methods. ALulzBot TAZ 5 desktop 3D printer was used to additively manu-facture the PLA. The printer operated with a 5 mm nozzle heated to210C and with perimeter, infill, and travel print speeds of 35, 50,and 95 mm/s, respectively. The printing bed was warmed to 60C.To manufacture injection molded specimens, a Galomb, Inc.Benchtop Injection Molder Model B-100 was used. The specimenswere prepared using a nozzle temperature of 156C and an injec-tion pressure of 586 kPa.Three types of test specimens were created through each ad-ditive manufacturing and injection molding processes: (1) tensilespecimens, (2)flexural specimens, and (3) thermal conductivityspecimens. Tensile specimen dimensions followedASTM D638(2014)Type IV, having a thickness of ~4.0 mm for both injection-molded and additive-manufactured specimens. Injection moldedflexure specimens were designed followingASTM D790 (2015)methods. These specimens measured 63 x 12.53.5 mm indimension  and  additive-manufacturedflexure  specimensmeasured 55 x 12.53.0 mm in dimension;flexural specimen spanlengths of 46 mm and 41 mm, respectively, were used for the 3-point bending tests to maintain a thickness to length ratio ofapproximately 0.075. For thermal conductivity measurements, diskspecimens were manufactured with 38 mm diameter and a thick-ness of 6 mm. The layer height of all additive-manufactured spec-imens was 0.3 mm, thusflexural specimens had 10 total layers,K. Kamau-Devers, V.R. Yanez, V.W. Medina Peralta et al.Journal of Cleaner Production 291 (2021) 1257992Stansbury and Idacavage, 2016Weiet al., 2015Krotký et al., 2016Letcher andWaytashek, 2014Wojtyła et al.,2017Tayet al., 2017Lu et al.,2014Barthelat, 2015Farbman and McCoy, 2016Davis et al., 2018Tay et al. (2017)Ameli et al., 2014Farbman andMcCoy (2016)Letcher andWaytashek (2014)Trhlikovaet al. (2016)Allwood, 2018ASTM D638(2014)ASTM D790 (2015)tensile specimens had 13 total layers, and thermal conductivityspecimens had 20 total layers. Specimens were printed with 2 solidlayers on either faceesimilar to structural sandwich panelse(with the remaining layers being octogram-spiral pattern), thustotaling 4 solid layers per specimen. Noting that mechanicalproperties of semi-crystalline polymers, such as PLA, can be sus-ceptible to aging, which can influence mechanical properties(Srubar et al., 2012), all mechanical tests were performed afterspecimens were conditioned for 7 days at a temperature of23.3C±0.8C and relative humidity of 37.0%±2.6%.2.3. Internal geometriesTo examine the effects of the density of a micro-scale internalarchitecture on material behavior, varying infill percentages weretested for the additive-manufactured specimens. Computer auto-mated design software were used to create the base models foreach specimen type and Slic3r (3DSlicer;Fedorov et al., 2012)software was used to create the infill patterns for thefinal printfiles. For this work, an infill pattern of an octagram spiral wasselected (infills depicted inFig. 1). This infill pattern was selectedbecause the voided internal microstructure follows a continuous,but circuitous, path across the specimens. As such, it was hypoth-esized that increased energy dissipation could be achieved at fail-ure as a crack would not easily propagate directly across thespecimens. Four pattern infill percentages were chosen: 25%, 50%,75%, and 100%. Subject to printer accuracy, the 25% infill containsapproximately 25% of the potential volume offilament internally;the 100% infill percentage specifies a solid infill, still following thesame internal structure for deposition. True densities of specimenswere measured using a XS205 0.01 mg scale by Mettler Toledo withsolids density kit. The dimensions of the specimens used to mea-sure the densities were 24 x 12.5 x 3.0 mm.2.4. Mechanical property assessmentTwo series of mechanical property tests were performed. Tensiletests followedASTM D638 (2014)testing protocols to determineelastic modulus, ultimate strength, toughness, and percent elon-gation. All tensile specimens were tested at a rate of 5 mm/min. Theaverage cross-sectional dimensions of the tensile specimens were6.5 mm (width) x 4.0 mm (thickness). Elastic modulus was deter-mined based on the tangent calculated from 5 to 15% of the ulti-mate strength for each of the specimens. Flexural tests of thespecimens were conducted usingASTM D790 (2015)for three-point loading to determineflexural modulus, ultimate strength,and toughness. Width, thickness, and span length measurementsforflexure specimens were as noted in Section2.3. Flexuralmodulus was determined based on the tangent calculated from 5 to15% of the ultimate strength for each of the specimens. An MTSLandmark Servohydraulic Test System running 793.00 V softwareversion 5.9E 6055 was used for the mechanical experiments. Fivespecimens were tested for each infill percentage, for both tensileandflexural property experiments. For injected-molded specimens,3 specimens were tested for tensile property experiments and 7 forflexural property experiments.2.5. Material comparisons with Ashby indicesIn addition to analysis of mechanical properties and specificproperties with respect to varying infill percentages, material effi-ciency was assessed through use of Ashby design indices (Ashby,2002). These indices facilitate rapid comparison between multi-ple material properties to inform the most desirable material for aset  application.  In  addressing  the  potential  for  additivemanufacturing to improve material efficiency, such indices can beused to concurrently assess benefits gained through reduction inmass of material required and alterations in material properties. Inthis work, three comparison indices are used to assess the additivemanufactured and injection molded PLA. These indices includethose for: a tensile strut controlled by stiffness, a beam in bendingcontrolled by stiffness, and a beam in bending controlled bystrength. In considering material efficiency through the Ashbymethod (Ashby, 2002), the goal used herein was to minimize masswhile meeting the deflection and strength criteria.Table 1presentsthe indices considered. For Equations 1 to 3 (inTable 1),EtandEfrepresent the materials tensile andflexural moduli, respectively,whileris the material density, andsfis the ultimateflexuralstrength of the beam. These Ashby indices, when maximized,would result in the most favorable combination of density andcorresponding mechanical property, to minimize the mass of thedesigned component. For the stiffness controlled tensile strut, theindex to be maximized equals the specific tensile modulus (seeEquation (1)).2.6. Thermal conductivity assessmentThermal conductivity for each additive-manufactured infillpercentage and the injection-molded specimens was assessed us-ing a Hot Disk Thermal Constants Analyzer TPS 2200 by ThermTest,Inc. Thermal conductivity was evaluated at ambient conditions:23.3C±0.8C and relative humidity of 37.0%±2.6%. SpecimensFig. 1.Sample Infill percentages.

The experiments were conducted using heatingpowers between 2.5 and 7.5 mW with 5e10 s measuring times, a5465 probe (3.189 mm), and a specimen depth thickness of6.00 mm. Tests were run by placing the heat probe between twospecimens of the same type; 6 iterations of tests were performedfor the additive manufactured specimens and for the injection-molded specimens.2.7. Energy and plastic demand assessment2.7.1. Scope of assessmentIn addition to analysis of material properties of PLA with voidedinternal structures facilitated by additive manufacturing and solidinjection molded specimens, this work includes an initial assess-ment of alterations to resource demand in producing componentsusing these two manufacturing methods. Namely, consideration forhow using additive manufacturing can alter the demand for plasticin components and effects on energy demand were assessed. Toperform these assessments, plastic demand for a set volume wasdetermined based on component density and material wastagefrom different processing methods. Energy demand was deter-mined using the cumulative energy demand method in theSimaPro software package (PReConsultants, 2019) for theflows andprocesses stipulated inFig. 2. To examine the effects of the twomanufacturing methods, use of additive manufacturing based onenergy measurements at the laboratory-scale were compared touse of injection molding based both on laboratory-scale measure-ments and on industrial-scale data.2.7.2. Inventoryflows and modelsTo determine plastic and energy demand for each of themanufacturing methods considered and for various infill percent-ages, inventories were determined to assess plastic and energyinputs. Models were developed for the manufacturing of 1 kg ofmaterial using each method and scaled using measured densities todraw comparisons based on a cubic meter of plastic component.Electricity required to print 1 kg of an additive manufactured plasticcomponent was measured using an Onset HOBO UX120-018 PlugLoad Logger, model number ux120-018þBHW-PRO-CD. Electricityused to heat the plastic for laboratory-scale injection molding weremeasured using the same logger. Electricity demands for theseprocesses were measured as 45.55 MJ/kg and 2.87 MJ/kg for theadditive manufacturing and injection molding demand, respec-tively. As the pressure in the laboratory-scale injection molder wasprovided by a laboratory air-pressure unit, this demand wasmodeled as a function of the pressure used (rounded to 600 kPa forthe purposes of assessment) and the volume of the chamber,16 cm3. To perform a quantitative assessment of the energy andplastics demand, unit processes based on published data sourcesTable 1Ashby Indices for strut and beam design scenarios.Design ComponentDesign ConstraintAshby IndexStiffness Controlled Tensile StrutDeflectionðEtrÞEq. 1Beam in Bending Ashby Index (light and stiff)DeflectionðEf1=3rÞEq. 2Beam in Bending Ashby Index (light and strong)Failure momentðsf1=2rÞEq. 3Fig. 2.Scope of resource demand assessment, considering raw material demand, plastic production, transportation, and three potential manufacturing methods to produce plasticcomponents.K.

Additionally, transportation-related energydemand was modeled assuming plastics production in the SanFrancisco Bay Area and transportation of 150 km by diesel-poweredtruck.For the manufacturing processes assessed, the production ofPLA was assumed to be the same; quantities of waste were based onindustrial scale models and energy demand was examined usingmodels adapted was examined to reflect production in California.For all manufacturing processes, electricity was modeled using amixture of energy resources for the California average electricitygrid in 2017, reported by theCalifornia Energy Commission (2018).In this representative grid, unit processes for electricity frombiomass, bituminous coal, nuclear, diesel, and natural gas weremodeled using data reported by the National Renewable EnergyLaboratory (NREL, 2012); electricity from hydropower and windpower were modeled using inputs from the European Platform onLife Cycle Assessment (European Commision, 2018); electricityfrom municipal waste and photovoltaics were modeled on datafrom ecoinvent (Althaus et al., 2007;Weidema and Hischier, 2010);finally, electricity from geothermal plants were based on data fromFrick et al. (2010). An adaptation of the polylactide, granulate, atplant process reported by ecoinvent (Althaus et al., 2007) was madeusing this electricity grid. Transportation-related energy demandwas captured using the truck transportation, single unit truck,diesel powered model fromFranklin Associates (2013). For theadditive manufactured plastic components, the production offila-ment was modeled using a model for extrusion of plastics pipes(based on (Hischier, 2007)), with the California electricity grid andnatural  gas  for  thermal  energy.  The  remainder  of  themanufacturing demand was reflected as the measured electricityrequirement from laboratory testing, with the California electricitygrid. For the lab-scale injection molding model, compressed air wasmodeled using the compressed air average generation,>30 kW,6 bar gauge model by (Steiner and Frischknecht, 2007), selected toreflect the pressure used in the lab setting, with the electricitydemand in this process modeled as the California grid. Electricitywas used for the energy for the heating element, which wasmodeled using the measured electricity requirement from labora-tory testing, with the California electricity grid. As a comparison,industrial-scale injection molding of the plastic was also modeledbased on the injection molding, rigid LLDPE part, at plant modelfromFranklin Associates (2011), adapted using the Californiaelectricity grid and natural gas for thermal energy. From theextrusion process offilament, approximately 0.004 kg of plastic arewasted through processing per kg extruded (Hischier, 2007) andthrough injection molding, approximately 0.045 kg of plastic arewasted through processing per kg injection molded (FranklinAssociates, 2011). These waste values were used to appropriatelyscale energy demand and serve as a metric used in the assessmentof plastic demand for the components analyzed.3. Results and discussion3.1. DensityAdditive manufacturing can dramatically lower componentdensity; however, these reductions are not as great as the change ininfill percentage itself.Table 2shows specimen densities for bothinjection-molded  and  printed  specimens,  where  densitiesincreased with increasing percent infill, with a 1:1 correlation be-tween infill percentage and actual density. The 25% infill had thegreatest decrease from the injection molded specimen, at roughly30%. This difference could represent significant savings in mass ofmaterial. For PLA with less than 75% infill, the components becomeless dense than water.3.2. Mechanical properties3.2.1. Absolute propertiesIn addition to changes in density, infill fraction contributed tochanges in strength, elastic modulus, and toughness. A summary ofmechanical properties measured are presented inTable 3. Ultimatetensile strength (st), ultimateflexural strength (sf), tensilemodulus (Et), andflexural modulus (Ef) generally increased withincreasing percent infill. The greater cross-sectional density of thesolid infill from injection molding resulted in the highest me-chanical properties for each of these properties, with increases of atleast ~30% relative to the lowest 25% infill. The exception to me-chanical properties increasing with increasing percent infill was the75% infill tensile modulus, Et, which was slightly lower than thosewith 25% and 50% infills. This drop in Etcan perhaps be explainedby the inelastic behavior. Though an Etof 1960.0 MPa was found forthe 75% infill, it had higher toughness than both 25% and 50% infillsat 0.77 MPa. All of the additive manufactured specimens displayedhigher toughness and percent elongation (%EL) than the injectionmolded PLA. The greatest toughness was found for the 75% infillspecimens, which was observable in stress-strain plots.Fig. 3showspercent elongation (%EL) and toughnessfindings as well as repre-sentative stress-strain plots for different infill geometries, forspecimens tested in tension. The %EL of the 75% infill specimenexceeded that of the 25% specimen by ~19%. Even though there wasa drop in tensile modulus (Et) for the 75% infill relative to the 25%and 50% infill, it displays properties of greater energy dissipationthan the lower infill percentages.Unlike the strength and modulifindings, toughness in bothtension andflexure did not follow the same trends with varyinginfill percentage. For 25%e75% infill specimens, the gains insfandEfcoincided with increases inflexural toughness. However, theflexural toughness was fairly consistent for the 100% additive-manufactured specimen relative to the 75% infill at 3.23 and3.39 MPa, respectively. The consistent toughness occurred despitean increase insfand Ef,reflecting a loss in ductility associated withincreased infill percentage. This trend was also seen in the tensilespecimen results, with decreases in %EL for the 100% infill tensilespecimen relative to the 75% infill, and similarly a loss in toughness.Specifically, for the tensile specimens, as the infill percentageincreased beyond 75% to reach 100%, both %EL and toughnessdropped by 10% and 3%, respectively.Overall, it was shown that it is possible to increase energydissipation through the control of infill geometry. The 75% infillspecimen achieved the greatest %EL and toughness, having valuesof 3.24% and 0.77 MPa, respectively, while the injection moldedspecimen achieved the lowest (shown inFig. 3a). The injectionmolded specimen, which displayed the least ductility, exhibited abrittle, linear relationship between stress and strain in tesnion withyield, ultimate, and failure strengths occurring nearly simulta-neously, shown inFig. 3b. The control of infill geometry with ad-ditive manufacturing resulted in nonlinear stress-strain inelasticbehavior and greater toughness than the solid infill.Table 2Density properties of all specimens.SpecimenDensity (g/cm3)25%0.89150%0.96575%1.013100%1.096Injection Molded1.262K.

(2010)Althaus et al., 2007Franklin Associates (2013)Hischier, 2007Steiner and Frischknecht, 2007Franklin Associates (2011)Hischier, 2007FranklinAssociates, 2011Fig. 3Fig. 3Fig. 3It is likely that the additive manufactured specimens exhibitedincreases in %EL and toughness as a function of internal geometriesand their layered structures. The multilayered internal structuremay allow for crack deflection through the interfaces and geometry,leading to better dissipation of mechanical energy relative to thesolid injection molded infills (Barthelat, 2015). This delaminationconcept may explain the higher %EL relative to the injected-moldedspecimens. For additive manufactured specimens, layers do not failsimultaneously upon loading as cracks may have multiple centersof origin and have more opportunities to deflect; such mechanismsallow for larger deformations (Ngo et al., 2018) and inducedelamination (Ngo et al., 2018). Contrarily, as a solid cross sectionfails, once an initial crack forms its propagation path is undeterred,leading to almost immediate fracture and more brittle behavior.Trends for both %EL and toughness also showed that there wasperhaps an optimal infill percentage. Losses or plateauing in %ELand toughness occurred once a certain infill percentage wasexceeded, as discussed previously for 75% and 100% additivemanufactured specimens. Specifically, the toughness and %EL forthe 100% additive manufactured specimens in both tension andflexure indicated a leveling or declining relative to the 75% additivemanufactured specimens; although, the values of the 100% additivemanufactured specimens were still greater than those of the solidinfill values of 0.46 MPa (tension), 1.83 MPa (flexure), and 1.77%(tension), respectively (seeTable 3andFig. 3a). It is possible there isan optimal infill percentage (shown here to be the 75% additivemanufactured specimens), beyond which the infill in the additivemanufactured specimens may begin to detrimentally effect thespecimen’s ability to dissipate energy. Alternatively, it is possiblethat the fusing offilaments in the 100% infill specimen simply resultin it performing more like a solid infill. Based on visual inspection,shifts noted are not believed to be from inherent imperfections orcommon issues caused from additive manufacturing, such as pil-lowing or warping that may occur and exacerbate with increasedprint time for the greater infills.Mechanicalfindings also suggested that failure and deformationmechanisms may differ between tensile andflexural loading as afunction of infill percentage.Fig. 4represents modulus and ultimatestrength data for tension andflexure for the additive manufacturedspecimens. For the 75% infill specimens there were noticeable in-creases in bothflexural strength and modulus, 15% and 12%,respectively, relative to the 50% infill. These increases were notpresent in tension. As tensile properties showed roughly no changewith increasing infill percentage between 50% and 75%, it isbelieved that the compression surfaces in theflexure specimensinfluenced overall behavior, such that the greaterflexural proper-ties were achieved. For instance, delamination may manifestdifferently in compression.3.2.2. Specific propertiesSpecific properties were used to preliminarily assess aspects ofmaterial efficiency.

This concept isemphasized when considering the specific properties ofTable 4compared to the absolute properties ofTable 3.Table 4showsthat specific moduli and strength data of the 25% infill were eithergreater than or similar the injection-molded specimens, suggestinga more efficient use of material. For instance, the 25% infill hadspecificEfand specificsfvalues greater than that of the injectionmolded specimen, even though the 25% infill had lower absoluteflexural properties. For specificstand specificEt, values of39.6 MPa*cm3/g and 2292.1 MPa*cm3/g found for the injectionmolded specimen were only 4% and 3% higher than the 25% infillvalues, respectively. These percent differences for these specificproperties were considerably smaller than differences for absoluteproperties, where the injection moldedstand Etvalues were 47%and 46% greater than those of the 25% infill, respectively.Even though the 100% infill specimens had the highest modulusand strength absolute values of the additive manufactured speci-mens, lower percent infills proved equivalent or more efficientwhen examining specific properties. The 75% infill was typicallyfavorable, having higher specific property values for the majority ofproperties assessed, including specific tensile toughness,flexuraltoughness, %EL, Ef, andsf. As previously stated, thesefindingsillustrate the importance of considering the properties achievablefor a set mass of material.3.3. Material selection indicesAshby indices were applied to further assess the implication ofmass savings in design-specific applications. These indices allowminimization of a chosen property, often component weight, whilemaintaining certain mechanical design criteria as constraints, andthus can be more informative of mechanisms for increasing ma-terial efficiency than specific properties. For instance,Table 4showsthe 100% infill having the greatest specificsfat 86.4 MPa*cm3/g.However, when considering the Ashby indices for the design ofboth a light and stiff beam as well as for a light and strong beam(seeTable 1), the 25% infill displays improved property attributesbeyond the 100% infill by roughly 15% and 10%, respectively (Fig. 5).Fig. 5also generally illustrates the importance of considering ma-terial efficiency, as reverse trends are noticed for the Ashby indicesin comparison to their corresponding absolute mechanical prop-erties. These cases highlight the importance of such comparisonmetrics in revealing efficient utilization of material resources.For Ashby index of a tensile strut, the index and the specificmodulus were in fact equal to one another. Similar to the desirableattributes of the 25% infill for the bending indices, this infill wasbeneficial for the light and stiff tensile strut. The absolute Etof theinjection molded specimen was roughly 46% larger than that of the25% infill. Yet using the Ashby index for a tensile strut, the injectionmolded manufacturing method led to a combination of propertiesthat were only 3% larger than for the 25%, shown inFig. 6. Eventhough the 75% infill was shown to be the least efficient material forthe strut design, having an index of 1935 MPa*cm3/g, it was stillpreviously shown to be the most ductile infill in tension. Dependingon specific design requirements, ductility may be the critical designparameter or criteria of interest, for which the 75% infill may be themost desired infill.3.4. Thermal conductivityMaterial efficiency concepts were also examined with thermalconductivity properties. Improving the insulative properties ofmaterials can potentially lead to benefits in energy savings, espe-cially in the built environment. Polymers have been used as insu-lative foams (Cetiner and Shea, 2018) and have been used withother materials, such as wood, to attain better insulative perfor-mance and toughness as composites (Fowler et al., 2006). By con-trolling the internal geometry, the thermal conductivity ofthermoplastics can be reduced through the incorporation of airvoids. This trait is also found in nature, wherefibrous materialssuch as wood and straw generally have low thermal conductancebecause of air voids present throughout their cellular structure, afactor that also contributes to their low densities (Shea et al., 2013).As was expected, 25% infill had the lowest thermal conductivity ofthe specimens tested and thus would be the most efficient insulator(seeFig. 7). Thermal conductivity was found to be directly pro-portional to infill percentage, decreasing with increased air voids.The injected molded specimen had a thermal conductivity that was83% greater than the 25% infill.3.5. Resource demandAdditive manufacturing can allow for increased efficiency inmaterial demand through strategic placement of material; how-ever, this shift in material demand did not coincide with reducedenergy demand for production.Fig. 8a shows the cumulative en-ergy demand for all materials categorized by contributions fromplastic, manufacturing, and transportation. It can be seen that in-jection  molding  had  lower  energy  demand  than  additivemanufacturing.   Regardless   of   manufacturing   method,transportation-related energy demand resulted in less than 1% ofthe impact. Further, plastic energy demands were similar for allalternatives compared to manufacturing energy demand, wherethe ranges between least and greatest values for each of thesecategories differed by factors of ~50% compared to up to a 15 timesvariation, respectively. The greatest difference in energy-demandwas between the lab-scale injection molded specimen and the100% infill additive manufactured component. The manufacturingenergy demand of industrial-scale injection molding was greaterthan lab-scale injection molding by approximately 150%, yet stillfell below that of the 100% infill by a factor of ~6.7.As shown inFig. 8b, even though the injection molded processeswere shown to have the lowest cumulative energy demands rela-tive to additive manufacturing, analysis of plastic demand reflectedtheir higher densities. Injection molded plastic demand was foundto exceed the 100% infill by approximately 20%. While there is aTable 4Specific mechanical properties of all specimens (values represent averages from experimental results).TensileFlexuralSpecimenst(MPa*cm3/g)  Et(MPa*cm3/g)  Toughness (MPa*cm3/g)  %EL (%*cm3/g)  Ef(MPa*cm3/g)sf(MPa*cm3/g)  Toughness (MPa*cm3/g)25%38.122310.6693.042365084.23.0550%35.521200.7273.188353677.63.1275%34.419350.7553.194375585.23.35100%36.922800.6842.657362486.42.95Injection Molded39.622920.3641.400337078.91.45K.

So, even though injection molded specimens weresometimes shown to be less efficient based on mechanical prop-erties, density, and plastics consumption, differences in productionprocesses led to notable reduction in energy demand compared toprinted specimens.Though one of the main benefits of PLA is that it is biodegrad-able, solutions to address plastic waste still consist offinding waysto lessen the use plastics in general. One such way is through theconsideration of composite materials. Reinforcing biodegradablepolymers with naturalfiller, such as woodfibers, has been the focusof many studies, considering both mechanical and environmentalbenefits. For instance,Bledzki and Jaszkiewicz (2010)performedtensile and impact mechanical tests on bio-based wood polymercomposites (WPCs) derived from PLA and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)(PHBV).Kamau-Devers et al. (2019)analyzedthe sorption behavior of bio-based WPCs made from PLA at varyingtemperatures with ties to environmental impacts.Silwa et al.(2012)studied the mechanical and interfacial properties of a bio-based WPC composite made from a less commonly used matrixmaterial, Pebax®.Use of these kinds of composites may substantially decreaseplastic demand in conventionally manufactured components.Recent studies have also reflected an increased desire to explore theuse of natural reinforcingfillers in printingfilament (Liu et al.,2019), which could result in lower plastic demands in compo-nents manufactured from these composites. Recent studies in thisarea byMartikka et al. (2018)andMazzanti et al. (2019)assessedmechanical properties of 3-D printed materials made from natu-rally reinforced PLA. The use of composite materials would alsohave implications for density and thus integrating them in a ma-terial efficiency comparative study such as this would be a valuablefuture extension.4. ConclusionsMaterial efficiency was assessed for specimens made frompolylactic acid (PLA) with varied internal architectures. Injectionmolded specimens with a solid internal structure were comparedto additive manufactured PLA with different infill percentagesconsisting of an octagram spiral geometry. Through linked assess-ment of resource demand and material property alteration, thiswork provides a foundation for study in improved material effi-ciency through additive manufacturing. Severalfindings can bedrawn from this research:Changes in plastic manufacturing can improve ductility andimprove energy dissipation by altering failure and deformationmechanisms.More complex internal geometry can lead to greater energydissipation for additive manufactured specimens up to anoptimal infill percentage, after which there may be drop-offs orleveling in both percent elongation and toughness.Additive manufacturing can be used to achieve high materialefficiency, as indicated by analysis of specific mechanical prop-erties and Ashby indices. Ashby indices proved to be morerevealing of material efficiency for design-specific scenariosthan the specific properties.Fig. 5.(a) Comparison offlexural modulus and Ashby index for a beam in bending (light and stiff) and (b) Comparison of ultimate bend strength and Ashby index for a beam inbending (light and strong).

(2019)Control of internal geometry can lead to improved insulativeproperties for these plastics, particularly resulting from in-creases in air voids.The 25% infilled specimens demonstrated the best material ef-ficiency as an insulator and among Ashby indices for the per-mutations examined. For specific properties, the 75% infilledspecimens generally performed best of all the infills, onlytrailing other infills in specific tensile results.Energy demands can vary greatly between manufacturingmethods, which would implications on both environmentalimpacts and efficient utilization of resources.There were noticeable advantages found in having control ofspecimen internal structure. In future work, exploration should beconducted into how the type of geometry and infill percentage canbe varied to achieve optimal results. More robust analyses of failuremechanisms as they relate to geometry-specific (octagram spiral,honeycomb, etc.) loading pathways and stress distributions, as wellas crack propagation, can be used to further understand ductilebehavior. Studying thermoplastic failure mechanisms in compres-sion may also shed light on ductility and be compared to tensile andbend data.</a><br>
