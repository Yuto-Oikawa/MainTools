This study elucidates the characteristics of the parameters used in the recursive process as well as its ability in geometric modeling and 3D printing of 3D shapes. In the recursive process, three constants (center point, initial distance, and initial angle) and two variables (instantaneous distance and instantaneous rotational angle) are employed. The shape-modeling characteristics of the constants and variables are elucidated using some commonly used shapes (straight-line, circle, ellipses, spiral, astroid, S-shape, and leaf-shape). In addition, the shape-modeling capability of the recursive process as a whole is quantified using two parameters called the radius of curvature and aesthetic value. Moreover, an illustrative example that shows the ecacy of the recursive process in virtual and physical prototyping of a relatively complex 3D object is presented. The results show that reverse engineering performed by the recursive-process-created point cloud is free from computational complexity compared to reverse engineering performed by the 3D-scanner-created point cloud. As such, the outcomes of this study enrich the field of reverse engineering. </a><br><br><a id="s2" onmouseover="over('s2', 'r2')" onmouseout="out('r2')">Keywords: geometric modeling; additive manufacturing; reverse engineering; point cloud; design for additive manufacturing </a><br><br><a id="s3" onmouseover="over('s3', 'r3')" onmouseout="out('r3')">1. Introduction </a><br><br><a id="s4" onmouseover="over('s4', 'r4')" onmouseout="out('r4')">Additive manufacturing (AM) (in common terms, 3D printing) has emerged as a useful process for producing complex shapes directly from the solid 3D CAD models of the shapes [1–7]. Numerous industrial sectors have been benefitting from AM, including the automotive industry [8], the aerospace industry [1], the biomedical engineering field (e.g., dental braces, artificial tissues, hearing aids, dummy cadavers, and prosthetics) [9–15], the education field [16–18], the fashion industry (e.g., cloth, shoes, and jewelry) [19–23], the food industry (e.g., pizza, chocolate, crackers, and pasta) [24–28], and the construction industry (e.g., 3D printed houses) [29–32]. AM has also been applied to preserving and restoring cultural heritage [33]. Thus, the advent of AM has created a new field called Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM). One of the objectives of DfAM is to manage the complexity in the geometry and topology of a given object for the ease of AM [34]. </a><br><br><a id="s5" onmouseover="over('s5', 'r5')" onmouseout="out('r5')">The typical steps underlying an AM process are Steps 4 to 7, as shown in Figure 1. In some cases, particularly when a given object is reverse engineered [35–37], Steps 1 to 3 in Figure 1 must be added to make the process meaningful. Therefore, some of the challenges of DfAM are rooted in Steps 2 and 3, as described below. Math. Comput.

Additive manufacturing from the viewpoint of reverse engineering. When a given object is reverse engineered, a data acquisition process is required, as shown by Step 2. In most cases, data acquisition is based on image processing, sketch processing, scanned point cloud processing, or analytical point cloud processing. In the case of image processing, the image data of a given object are extracted. Afterward, the data are processed by an appropriate computational method (Step 3) for making the information meaningful to a CAD package for solid modeling. In the case of sketch processing, a given object is sketched and then the sketch data are processed by an appropriate computational method for making the information meaningful to a CAD package for solid modeling. In the case of scanned point-cloud processing, a given object is scanned by a 3D scanner and then represented by a relatively large set of points known as a point cloud. Afterward, the point cloud is processed by an appropriate computational method for making the information meaningful to a CAD package for solid modeling. Thus, the abovementioned data acquisition processes require either image processing or point cloud processing. The computational complexity and the respective solutions have been studied by numerous authors, as reported in [38]. For the sake of better understanding, the following articles can be noted that show the computational details regarding raster to vector graphics conversion [39–41], sketch processing [42–44], data registration [9,45–47], noise removal [48,49], data reduction [50,51], curve-based surface reconstruction [42,52–58], polygon-based surface reconstruction [59–63], and direct slicing [64–68]. Compared to the image processing, sketch processing, and scanned point-cloud processing, analytical-point-cloud-processing-based reverse engineering is still in infancy. However, one of the advantages of analytical-point-cloud-based reverse engineering is that it can restrict the size of the point cloud to a small one. This way, some of the computational complexity as mentioned above can be avoided, as shown by the authors in [69]. On the other hand, there is an inherent problem, that is, what is the best approach to create an analytical point cloud? In this regard, there are multiple approaches. An analytical point cloud can be created using a deterministic approach [38,70], a semi-random approach or affine mapping-based approach [34,71], and a fully random approach [72]. In each case, the 3D solid model construction process can be systematized using the information underlying the analytically created point cloud. This is perhaps not the case when the other approaches are used to create the point cloud. In this article, the focus is on the deterministic point cloud that is created by a recursive process as shown in [38,69,70]. This process uses two variables and three constants, which are user-defined. The role and the characteristics of these variables and constants must be known beforehand to Figure 1.

Characteristics of the Point-Cloud-Creating Algorithm </a><br><br><a id="s20" onmouseover="over('s20', 'r20')" onmouseout="out('r20')">Recall the following question. What are the characteristics and roles of the variables and constants used in the recursive process that deterministically creates a point cloud? The recursive process, called the point cloud creation algorithm (PCA), that creates a point cloud on a plane is shown in Appendix A. As shown in Appendix A, PCA needs three constants as inputs—namely, the center point, Pc; initial distance, d; and initial angle, '—that remain the same for all iterations. In addition, PCA needs two variables as inputs—namely, instantaneous rotational angle, i and instantaneous distance, ri, i = </a><br><br><a id="s21" onmouseover="over('s21', 'r21')" onmouseout="out('r21')">0, 1, ..., n—that may change in every iteration. The PCA creates the output, denoted as PC = </a><br><br><a id="s22" onmouseover="over('s22', 'r22')" onmouseout="out('r22')">{Pei | i = </a><br><br><a id="s23" onmouseover="over('s23', 'r23')" onmouseout="out('r23')">0, 1, ..., n}, which is a small-size point cloud. As such, the output of PCA, PC depends on d, ', i, </a><br><br><a id="s24" onmouseover="over('s24', 'r24')" onmouseout="out('r24')">and ri. This input–output relationship is characterized by using some well-known shapes, namely, straight-line, circle, ellipse, spiral, astroid, S-shape, and leaf-shape. The description is as follows. </a><br><br><a id="s25" onmouseover="over('s25', 'r25')" onmouseout="out('r25')">First, consider the point clouds that evolve due to the linear settings of the instantaneous rotational angle and distance. These settings create some point clouds presenting straight lines, circles, and spirals, as shown in Figures 2–5. For example, consider a point cloud that models a straight line. In this case, i must be kept constant and ri must linearly increase or decrease. When i = </a><br><br><a id="s26" onmouseover="over('s26', 'r26')" onmouseout="out('r26')">0◦ and ri linearly increases for all iterations, the PCA creates a point cloud, PC, presenting a horizontal line, as shown in Figure 2. When i = 90◦ and ri linearly increases for all iterations, the PCA creates, PC, presenting a vertical line, as shown in Figure 3. The slope of the straight line can be modeled using i. When an opposite strategy is adopted, that is, i is increased or decreased linearly and ri is kept constant, the point cloud, PC, presents a shape called a circle, as shown in Figure 4. In this case, the radius of the circle can be modeled using ri. On the other hand, when both i and ri are increased or decreased simultaneously, then the point cloud, PC, presents a shape called a spiral, as shown in Figure 5. </a><br><br><a id="s27" onmouseover="over('s27', 'r27')" onmouseout="out('r27')">In the next step, consider the relatively complex settings of the instantaneous distance while keeping the instantaneous rational angle increase linear. For example, when i is increased linearly and ri follows a tent function, then the point cloud, PC, presents a shape called leaf-shape, as shown in Figure 6. When i increases linearly and ri follows a sine or cosine function with two cycles, then the point cloud, PC, presents a shape called ellipse, as shown in Figure 7. Similarly, when i increases linearly and ri follows a u-shape function with four cycles, then the point cloud, PC, presents a shape called astroid, as shown in Figure 8. When i increases linearly and ri follows a bathtub function with two cycles, then the point cloud, PC, presents a shape called S-shape, as shown in </a><br><br><a id="s28" onmouseover="over('s28', 'r28')" onmouseout="out('r28')">Math.

As shown in Figures 2–9, keeping i very simple (constant or straight-line) and varying ri using some simple functions (straight-line, tent function, sine/cosine, u-shape function, and bathtub functions) can model a variety of shapes. The findings are summarized in Table 1.

To calculate i, the point itself and two more preceding consecutive points are needed. The variability in i is calculated for circle, ellipse, and spiral, as shown in Figures 11–13. Figure 11 shows two point clouds of the same shape, circle. Figure 11a shows the point cloud of the circle modeled by Equation (A1), where the radius, a = </a><br><br><a id="s128" onmouseover="over('s128', 'r128')" onmouseout="out('r128')">100 and center, Pc = (150,150).

In this case as well, 49 points are created to model the circle. Figure 11d shows the values of i, which is equal to 100.21. This means that for a circle, ri plays the role of the radius of curvature of a circle. Figure 12 shows two point clouds of the same shape, ellipse. Figure 12a shows the point cloud of the ellipse modeled by Equation (A2), where the major radius, a = </a><br><br><a id="s134" onmouseover="over('s134', 'r134')" onmouseout="out('r134')">54; minor radius, b = 46; and center, </a><br><br><a id="s135" onmouseover="over('s135', 'r135')" onmouseout="out('r135')">Pc = </a><br><br><a id="s136" onmouseover="over('s136', 'r136')" onmouseout="out('r136')">(80, 80).

In this case as well, 49 points are created to model the ellipse. Figure 12d shows the variation of i. As seen in Figure 12a,c, it is clear that both point clouds are identical and their radius of curvature (Figure 12b,d) also varies in the same trend. This means that for an ellipse, ri plays the role of the radius of curvature of an ellipse. Figure 13 shows two point clouds of the same shape, spiral.

As seen in Figure 13a,c, it is clear that both point clouds are identical and their radius of curvature (Figure 13b,d) also varies in the same trend. This means that for spiral, ri plays the role of a radius of curvature of a spiral. </a><br><br><a id="s151" onmouseover="over('s151', 'r151')" onmouseout="out('r151')">It is clear from Figures 11–13, the shape modeled by the parametric equation based and the PCA are visually identical. This means that the instantaneous distance plays the role of the radius of curvature when the shape is modeled by the PCA. The variation of the instantaneous distance is comparatively lower than the radius of curvature, which shows that the geometry of the shape can be easily controlled using the instantaneous distance compared to the radius of curvature. It is worth mentioning that there are several key elements for shape designing, and mathematical formulation of the radius of curvature or instantaneous distance can be one eective approach [74].

The procedure to construct LCH for a given curve (in this case from a given point cloud) is also shown in Appendix B. For quantification of the aesthetic value, the ellipse and spiral shape are considered. Figure 14a shows the point cloud of the ellipse modeled by Equation (B.2), which is repeated from the previous section (Figure 12a). The corresponding LCH of the ellipse is shown in Figure 14b. Figure 14c shows the point cloud of the ellipse modeled by the PCA (repeated from Figure 12c). The corresponding LCH of the ellipse is shown in Figure 14d.

It is also observed that the length of the line segment in the LCH depends on the variation range (minimum value to maximum value) of the radius of curvature.

An Ewer from Seto ware. (a) A photograph of the Ewer [78]; (b) an illustration of the ewer; (c) individual point clouds. The steps for solid CAD modeling are described as follows. In the first step, the individual point clouds PC1, PC2, PC3, PC4, and PC5 are sequentially synthesized by a C0 continuity approach which represents the basic point cloud of the ewer body. The resulting point cloud is shown in Figure 17a. These point clouds are then transferred to a commercially available 3D CAD package for solid modeling. By revolving the point cloud 360°, a solid CAD model of the ewer body is constructed. The result is shown in Figure 17b. In the second step, the point clouds PC6, PC7, and PC8 are sequentially synthesized by a C0 continuity approach which represents the basic point cloud of the spout. The resulting point cloud is shown in Figure 18a. The point clouds are then injected into the solid CAD model of the body as shown in Figure 18b. Here, P1 and P2 represent the start point and endpoint of PC7 and are connected to the endpoint of PC6 and start point of PC8, respectively. For the other points, P3 denotes the endpoint of PC8 and P4 denotes the starting point of PC6. The point clouds must be iterated so that P3 and P4 must lie on a tangent to the surface of the body. Taking P1 and P2 as reference points, plane 1 is created and then an ellipse is constructed on plane 1, as shown in Figure 18c. Similarly, taking P3 and P4 as reference points, plane 2 is created and then another ellipse is constructed on plane 2, as shown in Figure 18c. Now, these two ellipses are joined by applying the lofted function to form the spout, as shown in Figure 18d. Afterward, a hollow is created inside the solid CAD model by offsetting surface and hiding the solid body and applying the thicken function on the offset surface. The resulting solid CAD model is shown in Figure 18e. In the third step, the point cloud PC9, shown in Figure 19a, is injected on the solid CAD model, as shown in Figure 19b. In this case, PC9 must iterate so the start point P5, and endpoint P6, must lie on the mid-section of the outer and inner surface of the body, shown in Figure 19b. Taking P5 and PC9 as a reference, plane 3 is created and then the ellipse is constructed on plane 3, as shown in Figure 19c. Then, applying the sweep function on the ellipse and taking PC9 as a sweep path, a handle is created. The resulting solid CAD model is shown in Figure 19d.

It is found that varying the pair of the instantaneous distance and instantaneous rotational angle in different combinations can create many different shapes. For examples, in this study, a straight-line, circle, ellipses, spiral, astroid, S-shape, and leaf-shape are created using five different combinations of instantaneous distance and instantaneous rotational angle. The first constant (center point) can perform the function of translation in both x- and y-axis directions. The second constant (initial angle) can perform the function of rotation of shape around the center point. However, the third constant does not affect the shape to be modeled; it is only necessary for placing the starting point. A planner shape can be modeled by a recursive-process-created point cloud and by a parametric-equation-created point cloud. If both point clouds are the same in terms of some quantitative measures, then it can be said that the recursive-process-based shape modeling approach is as good as the parametric-equation-based shape modeling approach. This is verified using three well-known shapes, namely, circle, ellipse, and spiral. In the verification process, the parameters called the radius of curvature and aesthetic value are used. It is observed that both point clouds of a given shape (one generated by the recursive process and the other generated by the parametric equation) have the same radius of curvature and aesthetic value. It is also found that the instantaneous distance plays the role of a radius of curvature. This means that it is not difficult to predict the values of the instantaneous distance compared to those of the radius of curvature while modeling an arbitrary shape. In addition, an illustrative example that shows the efficacy of the recursive process in virtual and physical prototyping of a relatively complex 3D object is presented. The results show that, compared to a 3D-scanner-created point cloud, the recursive-process-created point cloud helps avoid computational complexity in reverse engineering. It also makes reverse engineering more systematic of complex shape. Moreover, the recursive-process-created point cloud can be used to perform surface texturing. In the future, this study can be extended to develop a system that automatically generates a shape based on the user-defined inputs (instantaneous distance and rotational angle, and alike).
